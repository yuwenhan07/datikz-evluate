The timeline in Figure~\ref{fig:timeline} illustrates the progression of research activities across various leading groups from 2018 to 2023. The timeline is color-coded to highlight different research areas:

- \textbf{Red}: Digital Forensics (e.g., NTU)
- \textbf{Green}: Disinformation Detection (e.g., LMU)
- \textbf{Blue}: Generative AI (e.g., Cam)
- \textbf{Orange}: Other (e.g., AIT)
- \textbf{Purple}: Miscellaneous (e.g., PEC)

Each box represents a significant milestone or publication by the respective research group. For example, the red box labeled "NTU [?]?" indicates a notable contribution by the National University of Singapore in the field of digital forensics around 2021.
