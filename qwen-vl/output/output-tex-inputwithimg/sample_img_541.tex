\captionof{figure}{Two adjacent, troublesome slices: A 4-matching on \( W_5 \) containing two full-index troublesome slices, \( S \) (in \textcolor{red}{red}) and \( T \) (in \textcolor{blue}{blue}), that are somewhat, but not almost disjoint. Notice that our algorithm can choose either the outer edge of \( S \) or the outer edge of \( T \), but not both.}
