    \caption{This depicts the steps of the SR-LDPC encoding process. Information bits are encoded, the symbols of the LDPC codeword are indexed and stacked, and the resulting vector is compressed through matrix multiplication. The encoding is analogous for every user, each with their own sensing matrix.}
