    \caption{\textbf{Our approach outperforms previous SoTA real-time detectors.} The x-axis corresponds to the inference time. The y-axis corresponds to the mAP score on COCO \texttt{val2017}. All the models are trained with pretraining on Objects365. The NMS post-processing times are included for other models and measured on the COCO \texttt{val2017} with the setting from the official implementation~\cite{lyu2022rtmdet,yolov8_ultralytics,supergradients}, and the well-tuned NMS postprocessing setting (labeled as ``*'').}
