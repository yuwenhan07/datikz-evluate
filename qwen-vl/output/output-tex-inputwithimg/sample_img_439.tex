    \node at (2.5,0) {The critical eigenspace $V$ at the bifurcation point $(s^*,0)$ in Example~\ref{exa:lambda13}, where $s^*=10\pi^2$. The diagonal lines are intersections of two fixed point subspaces with $V$ and lead to EBL bifurcations. The horizontal dashed line is the intersection of $W_d$ with $V$ and leads to a BLIS bifurcation. The vertical dashed line leads to another similar BLIS bifurcation. The three line types correspond to the three group orbits of bifurcating solutions.};
