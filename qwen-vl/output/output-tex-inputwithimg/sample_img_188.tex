        We study a prediction model on feature vectors with differential under-reporting $X$ where true outcomes $Y$ are a function of the latent `true' features $Z$. Missingness $\xi$ is influenced by group membership $G$. We consider both cases in which feature distributions vary by group membership and cases with $G \perp Z$. In our setting, missingness indicators $\xi$ are unobserved and group membership $G$ is only used for model evaluation and not as a feature. The graph reflects the dependencies at prediction time.
