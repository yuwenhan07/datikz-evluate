    \caption{Illustrative comparison of a 2D dense matrix and a 2D sparse matrix. The dense matrix predominantly features non-zero elements, whereas the sparse matrix consists mainly of zero values with a few non-zero entries scattered throughout. Such distinctions highlight the storage and computational differences between the two matrix types.}
