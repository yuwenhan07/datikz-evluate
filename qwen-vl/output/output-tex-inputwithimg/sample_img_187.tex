    \caption{Schematic view of the different track types relevant for this paper, along with the used tracking detectors for these track types, showing the VELO detector, the TT detector, the magnet and the downstream tracking stations (T). The names of the tracking detectors along with the positioning of the magnet are indicated below the figure.}
