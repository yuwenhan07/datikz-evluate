\textit{Left}: Representation of the pairwise Transfer Entropy \( T_{p} \) and of the values obtained maximizing and minimizing \( T_{\alpha} \), called \( T_{M} \) and \( T_{m} \) respectively. Redundant influences are depicted by red arrows, and synergistic influences by blue arrows.

\textit{Right}: Pairwise, synergistic, and redundant conditioning path are represented on a simple model with four nodes, with simulated couplings indicated by the dashed gray arrows.
