The proposed braiding setup consists of three Majorana boxes mutually linked by tunneling with amplitudes \( t_{12} \), \( t_{13} \) and \( t_{23} \). The Majorana operator \( \gamma_{n \mu} \) denotes the MBS \( \mu \in \{1,\ldots,4\} \) in the box \( n \in \{1,2,3\} \). Two QDs (QD1 and QD2) are coupled via tunneling to the MBSs. The quantum dots, the driving field, and the environment remain identical to the case of a single Majorana box. The tunneling couplings are designed for attaining the jump operator~\eqref{eq:8by8_jump_operator_f_g_form} whose odd-parity dark states depend on the parameters \( f \) and \( g \) as shown in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:8by8_darkstate_psi1_f_g_form}-\eqref{eq:8by8_darkstate_psi2_f_g_form}.
