  "prompt": "The Cauchy slice $\\Sigma$ is the black curve and is cut in three parts by the horizons. $S_{\\rm L}$ and $S_{\\rm R}$ lie at the intersection between the black curve and the two diagonal lines. The red dot is a subregion of $S_{\\rm L}\\cup S_{\\rm R}$ The region spanned by equivalent slices $\\Sigma'$, equal to $D(\\Sigma_{\\rm L})\\cup D(\\Sigma_{\\rm E})\\cup D(\\Sigma_{\\rm R})$ is depicted in blue. Quantum extremal surfaces of each region are represented by black dots. All three belong to a Cauchy slice $\\Sigma_i'$ depicted by a dashed line. The $\\mathcal{C}_i$ are depicted by the red segments on $\\Sigma'$. The entanglement wedge associated to the choice of extremal surfaces $\\chi_i$ is the union of the three red regions.",
