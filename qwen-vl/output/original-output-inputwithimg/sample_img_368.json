  "prompt": "\\small{Decomposition $\\boldsymbol{J} = \\boldsymbol{U}_J \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_J \\boldsymbol{V}_J^\\top$ in the case where $r_J = 2$. Each of the joint components has an $n$-dimensional score vector (column of $\\boldsymbol{U}_J$) and a $p$-dimensional loading vector (row of $\\boldsymbol{V}_J^\\top$) associated with it; in this example, $n = 3$ and $p = 4$. Each subward has an $r_J$-dimensional score vector (row of $\\boldsymbol{U}_J$) associated with it, and each feature has a $r_J$-dimensional loading vector (column of $\\boldsymbol{V}_J^\\top$). Given that the singular values in $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_J$ are distinct and ordered from largest to smallest, the decomposition is identifiable up to multiplication of components by -1: we can multiply any column of $\\boldsymbol{U}_J$ and the corresponding column of $\\boldsymbol{V}_J$ (row of $\\boldsymbol{V}_J^\\top$) by -1 without changing the value of $\\boldsymbol{U}_J \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_J \\boldsymbol{V}_J^\\top$.}",
