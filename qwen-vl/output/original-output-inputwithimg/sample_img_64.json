Make sure to include the `tikz` package and the `arrows.meta` library in your preamble if you haven't already done so.\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Nodes**: Each compartment is represented by a node.\n- **Edges**: Directed edges represent transitions between compartments with labels indicating the corresponding rates or delays.\n- **Labels**: The labels on the edges are placed appropriately above or below the arrows.\n\nThis code should compile correctly in a LaTeX document. Adjustments may be necessary based on specific formatting requirements or additional features you want to add.",
