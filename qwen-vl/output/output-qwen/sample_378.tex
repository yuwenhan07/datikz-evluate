It seems you're describing a visual representation of a mathematical concept, specifically related to graph theory and the attachment of graphs. Let's break down the description:

1. **Left Image**: This part of the image shows a single triangle with its base extending towards the bottom. The apex of this triangle points upwards.

2. **Right Image**: This part of the image shows another single triangle, similar in structure to the one on the left, with its base extending towards the bottom and the apex pointing upwards.

3. **Graph Attachment**: The term "graph attachment" typically refers to the process of connecting two graphs together at a common vertex or edge. In your description, it appears that these two triangles are being connected at a point \(v\), which could be interpreted as the apex of both triangles if they were to be considered as part of a larger graph structure.

Given the description, it looks like the two triangles are meant to represent a simplified version of a graph where each triangle represents a subgraph, and they are joined at a common vertex \(v\). This kind of visualization is often used in graph theory to illustrate concepts such as graph connectivity, graph operations, or transformations.

If you need further clarification or have additional details about the theorem or the context in which this visualization is used, please provide more information!
