It seems like you're describing an image or a visual representation rather than a mathematical problem. However, I can help you understand the concept of \( \hat{k} \) for \( k = 0 \) to \( 4 \) when \( p = 3 \).

In mathematics, especially in the context of group theory or representation theory, \( \hat{k} \) often refers to the irreducible representations of a group. When \( p = 3 \), we are dealing with the group \( S_3 \) (the symmetric group on three elements), which has six irreducible representations.

The irreducible representations of \( S_3 \) are:
1. The trivial representation (dimension 1).
2. The sign representation (dimension 1).
3. Two 1-dimensional representations.
4. One 2-dimensional representation.

For \( k = 0 \):
- \( \hat{0} \) corresponds to the trivial representation (dimension 1).

For \( k = 1 \):
- \( \hat{1} \) corresponds to the sign representation (dimension 1).

For \( k = 2 \):
- \( \hat{2} \) corresponds to one of the two 1-dimensional representations (dimension 1).

For \( k = 3 \):
- \( \hat{3} \) corresponds to the other 1-dimensional representation (dimension 1).

For \( k = 4 \):
- \( \hat{4} \) corresponds to the 2-dimensional representation (dimension 2).

If you have a specific question about these representations or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
