It seems like you're discussing a comparison between two methods for generating probability bounds: one using program-agnostic neural Importance Sampling Methods (ISMs) and another using Farkas' Lemma. The goal is to visually compare these methods and determine which performs better under different conditions.

Here's a structured way to present this information:

### Comparison of Probability Bounds Using Neural ISMs and Farkas' Lemma

We have evaluated two approaches for generating probability bounds:
1. **Program-Agnostic Neural ISMs**
2. **Farkas' Lemma**

The performance of each method is visualized by plotting the probability bounds against a reference line \(y = x\). Points above the line indicate that the neural ISMs outperform Farkas' Lemma, while points below the line indicate the opposite.

#### Key Observations:

- **Above the Line**: Neural ISMs outperform Farkas' Lemma.
- **Below the Line**: Farkas' Lemma outperforms Neural ISMs.

This visualization demonstrates that neural ISMs can significantly outperform linear templates (like those derived from Farkas' Lemma) when a better bound exists. However, in cases where no significant improvement over Farkas' Lemma is possible, both methods yield similar results.

#### Additional Insights:

- **Program-Aware Neural ISMs**: When considering program-aware versions of neural ISMs, the performance is even more favorable compared to Farkas' Lemma. This suggests that incorporating domain-specific knowledge can lead to even better outcomes.

#### Visual Representation:

While the exact plot isn't provided here, it would be beneficial to create a scatter plot or a line graph showing the performance of both methods. The x-axis could represent the probability bounds generated by Farkas' Lemma, and the y-axis could represent the probability bounds generated by neural ISMs. The line \(y = x\) would serve as a reference, with points above indicating superior performance of neural ISMs and points below indicating superior performance of Farkas' Lemma.

#### Conclusion:

Neural ISMs offer a promising alternative to traditional methods like Farkas' Lemma, especially when a tighter bound is desired. However, their effectiveness depends on the specific problem at hand. Program-aware neural ISMs further enhance their performance, making them a valuable tool in many applications.
