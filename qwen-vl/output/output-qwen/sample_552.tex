To help you improve your diagram, I'll need to see both the code you've written and the image you're trying to reproduce. Please provide the code and the image so that I can assist you better.

If you don't have the code or the image, please describe the diagram in detail, including any specific elements you want to include (like the curved line, labels, shapes, etc.). Once I have this information, I can provide you with a more tailored solution.
