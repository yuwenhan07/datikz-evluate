To understand the scenario you're describing, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Definition of an Ear**: In graph theory, an "ear" in a planar graph is a path that starts and ends at distinct vertices, and each interior vertex of the path is also a vertex of the graph. The path can be thought of as growing from a base edge to form a new face.

2. **Graph Representation**: Consider a planar graph \( G \) where we have two ears \( P_i \) and \( P_j \). Each ear has exactly three edges, which means they are paths of length 2 (i.e., they consist of two edges and three vertices).

3. **Internal Vertex**: An internal vertex of an ear is any vertex along the path of the ear that is not the start or end vertex of the ear. For \( P_i \), if there is an internal vertex, it must be connected to both endpoints of \( P_i \).

4. **Impossible Case**: The scenario you describe involves an internal vertex of \( P_i \) being an endpoint of another ear \( P_j \). This creates a contradiction because:
   - By definition, an ear \( P_i \) cannot have an internal vertex that is also an endpoint of another ear \( P_j \).
   - If an internal vertex of \( P_i \) were also an endpoint of \( P_j \), it would imply that \( P_i \) and \( P_j \) share an internal vertex, which is not possible for two ears in a planar graph without violating the properties of ears.

5. **Visualization**: To visualize this, imagine drawing the graph such that \( P_i \) and \( P_j \) are drawn with their respective edges and vertices. If an internal vertex of \( P_i \) were also an endpoint of \( P_j \), it would mean that the graph contains a configuration where two ears share an internal vertex, which is not allowed in a valid planar graph.

Therefore, the scenario you described is indeed an impossible case in the context of planar graphs and the properties of ears. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The scenario where one endpoint of an ear } P_i \text{ with 3 edges is an internal vertex of some other ear } P_j \text{ with 3 edges is impossible.}}
\]
