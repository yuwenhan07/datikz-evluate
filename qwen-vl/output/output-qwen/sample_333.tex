It seems like you're describing a diagram or setup that might be related to a scientific experiment or a physics demonstration. However, without seeing the actual image, I can only provide a general interpretation based on your description.

The whiteboard with equations and symbols suggests that this could be a scientific or mathematical explanation, possibly involving fluid dynamics or thermodynamics given the presence of tubes and a square object (which could represent a block or a barrier).

Here's a possible scenario:

1. **Tubes**: These could represent pipes or conduits through which a fluid (like water or air) flows.
2. **Square Object**: This could be a block or a barrier that affects the flow of the fluid in some way.
3. **Lines and Symbols**: These might represent pressure, velocity, or other physical quantities involved in the flow.

If you have more specific details about what these symbols and equations represent, or if you need help interpreting a particular part of the diagram, feel free to share more information!
