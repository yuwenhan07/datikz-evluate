It seems like you're describing an image that contains three distinct geometric patterns or designs, each representing a different type of grid's relative 2-neighborhoods: the square grid, the triangular grid, and the king grid (also known as the chessboard knight's move). However, since I cannot see the image directly, I'll provide a general description based on your text.

The image likely shows:

1. **Square Grid**: This would depict a grid where each cell has four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
2. **Triangular Grid**: This would show a grid where each cell has six neighbors (up, down, left, right, diagonally up-left, and diagonally up-right).
3. **King Grid (Chessboard Knight's Move)**: This would illustrate a grid where each cell has eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonal directions).

Each of these grids can be represented by a pattern of squares or triangles, with the patterns showing how each cell is connected to its neighbors within a distance of two steps. For example, in the square grid, a cell at position (x, y) would have neighbors at positions (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1).

If you could describe the specific patterns or provide more details about the image, I'd be better equipped to help you interpret it!
