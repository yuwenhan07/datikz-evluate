The shape you're describing sounds like a dodecahedron, which is a polyhedron with twelve faces. However, the description of "triangles and squares" suggests that this might be a specific type of dodecahedron or a variation of one.

A regular dodecahedron has 12 faces, each of which is a regular pentagon. If the image you're referring to includes both triangles and squares, it could be a more complex structure, possibly a compound of two regular dodecahedra (which would have 20 faces) or a different type of polyhedron altogether.

If the model indeed resembles a dodecahedron but with additional triangular and square faces, it might be a modified or irregular dodecahedron. Such modifications can occur in various ways, such as truncating the vertices or edges, or adding extra faces.

To confirm the exact nature of the shape, we would need to see the image or have more detailed information about its construction. If you have access to the image, please share it, and I can provide a more accurate analysis based on the visual details.
