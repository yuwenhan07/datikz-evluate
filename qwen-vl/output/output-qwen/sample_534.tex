It seems you're describing a visual representation that involves a vertical reflection of an image or diagram labeled as "Fig.~conn3." This figure appears to be a vector graph featuring multiple overlapping loops, which are arranged in a circular pattern. Each loop is labeled with numbers and variables, suggesting a complex mathematical structure.

Given the description, it sounds like this could be part of a mathematical or scientific visualization, possibly related to network theory, graph theory, or some other field where such structures are common. The vertical reflection might imply a mirrored version of the original figure for comparison or analysis purposes.

If you need further assistance or have specific questions about the content or interpretation of this figure, feel free to ask!
