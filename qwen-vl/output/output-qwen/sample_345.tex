It seems like you're describing a visual representation that combines mathematical concepts with an artistic design. Here's how we can interpret your description:

1. **Grid Background**: The background is a grid with a white and black checkered pattern.
2. **Red Lines (F)**: These lines are one unit long and appear at the x-values of 1, 2, 3, and 4. They represent the function \( F \).
3. **Blue Lines (F-1)**: These lines are two units long and appear at the x-values of 0, 1, 2, and 3. They represent the function \( F^{-1} \) (the inverse of \( F \)).
4. **Intersection of Red and Blue Lines**: The intersections of these red and blue lines create a checkered pattern.

This setup could be part of a mathematical visualization or a graphical representation for educational purposes. If you need further assistance or have specific questions about this setup, feel free to ask!
