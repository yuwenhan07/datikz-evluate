It seems like you're working with a graph or network structure where nodes have labels and connections between them. Let's break down the information provided:

1. You have two sets of nodes:
   - \( \mathcal{E} = (-3, -1), (1, 3) \)
   - \( \mathcal{X}' = \{ X'_1, X'_2, X'_3 \} \)

2. The notation \( N(X'_i, \mathcal{X}') \) represents the neighbors of node \( X'_i \) in the set \( \mathcal{X}' \).

From the given information:
- \( N(X'_1, \mathcal{X}') = \{ X'_2 \} \)
- \( N(X'_2, \mathcal{X}') = \{ X'_1 \} \)
- \( N(X'_3, \mathcal{X}') = \{ X'_2 \} \)

This means:
- Node \( X'_1 \) is connected to node \( X'_2 \).
- Node \( X'_2 \) is connected to node \( X'_1 \).
- Node \( X'_3 \) is connected to node \( X'_2 \).

Now, let's interpret this in terms of the set \( \mathcal{D} \):
\[ \mathcal{D} = \{(X'_3, 2)\} \]

This suggests that there is an edge labeled with the value 2 connecting \( X'_3 \) to some other node. However, since we only have the information about the neighbors and not the full graph, it's not clear what the other node is.

If we assume that the label 2 is associated with the connection between \( X'_3 \) and \( X'_2 \) (since \( X'_2 \) is the neighbor of \( X'_3 \)), then the induced label 2 would be on the edge connecting \( X'_3 \) and \( X'_2 \).

So, the final interpretation is that the edge labeled 2 connects \( X'_3 \) to \( X'_2 \). If you need more details or clarification, please provide additional context or information.
