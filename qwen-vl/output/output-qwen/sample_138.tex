Based on your description, it seems you're referring to a visual representation of a scientific or mathematical study involving the transmission, amplification/reflection, and reception of Information Waves (IRs). This could be related to fields such as telecommunications, signal processing, or even quantum mechanics.

Here's a general breakdown of what the timeline might look like for a relay/IRS model:

1. **Transmission**: 
   - The source sends out an Information Wave (IR) which travels through space or a medium.
   - The IR is modulated with data, which could be represented mathematically using equations such as \( I(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \), where \( I(t) \) is the intensity of the wave at time \( t \), \( A \) is the amplitude, \( \omega \) is the angular frequency, and \( \phi \) is the phase angle.

2. **Amplification/Reflection**:
   - As the IR travels, it may encounter obstacles or mediums that can amplify or reflect the wave. For example, reflection can occur when the IR hits a boundary between two different media, such as from air to water or from one type of material to another.
   - The amplification or reflection can be modeled using equations like \( I_{\text{reflected}}(t) = R \cdot I_{\text{incident}}(t) \), where \( R \) is the reflection coefficient, which depends on the properties of the materials involved.

3. **Reception**:
   - The IR reaches the receiver, which then decodes the data embedded within the wave.
   - The reception process involves demodulation, which can be represented by equations such as \( m(t) = \frac{I(t)}{A} \), where \( m(t) \) is the message or data extracted from the wave.

The whiteboard diagram likely includes these equations and symbols, along with visual representations of the IRs and energy waveforms. It might also show how the IRs interact with each other and with the environment, including reflections and refractions.

If you have specific questions about any part of this process or need further clarification on the equations and symbols used, feel free to ask!
