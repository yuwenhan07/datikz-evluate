It seems like you're describing a complex mathematical or graph theory problem alongside an image that includes arrows. Let's break it down step by step.

### Mathematical Problem:
The statement "K' k-2i-1" appears to be part of a larger equation or inequality, but it's not clear what the variables \( K', k, i \) represent without more context. If we assume this is related to a graph theory problem, let's interpret it as follows:

- \( K' \) could be the number of vertices in a subgraph.
- \( k \) might be a parameter related to the structure of the graph.
- \( i \) could be another variable, possibly related to the index or position within the graph.

The phrase "for all j, k', there exists no edge between U'_j and U_" suggests that there is a specific condition about edges in the graph. Specifically, it implies that there are no edges connecting certain sets of vertices (denoted as \( U'_j \) and \( U_ \)).

### Graph Theory Interpretation:
Given the context of the image with red and blue arrows, we can infer that the graph has directed edges (arrows). The absence of edges between certain sets of vertices (\( U'_j \) and \( U_ \)) means that there are no directed paths from any vertex in \( U'_j \) to any vertex in \( U_ \).

### Visual Description:
The image you described shows a white and black picture with red and blue arrows. This could represent a directed graph where:
- Red arrows indicate one set of edges.
- Blue arrows indicate another set of edges.
- The absence of edges between certain sets of vertices (\( U'_j \) and \( U_ \)) is visually represented by the lack of arrows connecting these sets.

### Conclusion:
Without more specific details about the variables and the exact nature of the graph, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. However, based on the information provided, the problem likely involves constraints on the edges of a directed graph, specifically the absence of edges between certain subsets of vertices.

If you have more specific details or if this is part of a larger problem, please provide additional context so I can offer a more detailed analysis.
