It seems like you're describing an image or pattern that could be part of a larger design or artwork. However, without seeing the actual image, it's challenging to provide specific details about the patch "h_b,c". If you have a reference image or more context about what you mean by "patch h_b,c," please share it, and I'll do my best to assist you further.

If you're referring to a specific design element within the hexagonal pattern, such as a particular shape or color scheme, let me know which part you're interested in, and I can help you analyze or describe it better.
