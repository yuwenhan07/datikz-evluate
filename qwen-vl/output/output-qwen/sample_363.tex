To address the problem of finding the acyclic j-partitions of the parcycle \(C_{s_1, s_2}\) for \(j = 2, 3, 4\) where \(\{s_1, s_2\}\) is contained in the sink vertex, we need to understand the structure of the parcycle and the concept of an acyclic partition.

A parcycle \(C_{s_1, s_2}\) is a cycle graph with two additional vertices \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) connected to all other vertices in the cycle. The cycle itself has \(n\) vertices, say \(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\), and each \(s_i\) is connected to every vertex in the cycle. For simplicity, let's assume the cycle has \(n = 5\) vertices (i.e., \(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\)).

### Case \(j = 2\)
An acyclic 2-partition means dividing the vertices into two sets such that no edges exist between vertices in different sets. Since \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are both connected to all vertices in the cycle, they must be in the same set. Therefore, the only possible acyclic 2-partition is:
\[
\{\{s_1, s_2, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\}, \emptyset\}
\]
This is not a valid partition because it does not divide the vertices into two non-empty sets. Thus, there are no valid acyclic 2-partitions.

### Case \(j = 3\)
An acyclic 3-partition means dividing the vertices into three sets such that no edges exist between vertices in different sets. Again, since \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are both connected to all vertices in the cycle, they must be in the same set. The only way to partition the vertices into three sets is to have one set containing \(s_1\) and \(s_2\), another set containing some subset of the cycle vertices, and the third set being empty or containing the remaining vertices. However, this would not be acyclic because there would be edges between vertices in different sets. Thus, there are no valid acyclic 3-partitions.

### Case \(j = 4\)
An acyclic 4-partition means dividing the vertices into four sets such that no edges exist between vertices in different sets. Again, since \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are both connected to all vertices in the cycle, they must be in the same set. The only way to partition the vertices into four sets is to have one set containing \(s_1\) and \(s_2\), another set containing some subset of the cycle vertices, and the remaining two sets being empty or containing the remaining vertices. However, this would not be acyclic because there would be edges between vertices in different sets. Thus, there are no valid acyclic 4-partitions.

In conclusion, for \(j = 2, 3, 4\), there are no valid acyclic j-partitions of the parcycle \(C_{s_1, s_2}\) where \(\{s_1, s_2\}\) is contained in the sink vertex. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{No valid partitions}}
\]
