It seems there might be a misunderstanding in your description. A Venn diagram typically consists of two or more overlapping circles to represent sets and their intersections. The circles can vary in size and shape, but they are usually drawn as smooth, closed curves without irregularities unless specifically designed that way for artistic or illustrative purposes.

If you're referring to an artistic or conceptual representation rather than a standard mathematical one, it's important to clarify the context. If you have specific questions about drawing or interpreting such diagrams, feel free to ask!
