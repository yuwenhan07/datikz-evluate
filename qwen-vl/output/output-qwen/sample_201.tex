It appears you're describing an image that contains a series of yellow ducks arranged in a square pattern, with varying sizes and possibly different labels or values associated with them. However, there's a bit of confusion in your description as it mentions "1.1 foz," "1.2 bar," and "1.5 foz," which don't seem to directly relate to the ducks themselves but rather to measurements or values.

Hereâ€™s a structured way to describe this image:

**Image Description:**

The image features a series of yellow ducks arranged in a square grid pattern. There are multiple sizes of the same duck, ranging from smaller to larger versions. Each duck is labeled with a value, such as "1.1 foz," "1.2 bar," and "1.5 foz." These values might represent different attributes or measurements related to the ducks, though their exact meaning isn't clear without further context.

The ducks are evenly spaced within the grid, creating a visually organized layout. The arrangement suggests a matrix-like structure where each cell in the grid contains one duck, and the values next to or above the ducks could indicate specific characteristics or data points associated with each duck.
