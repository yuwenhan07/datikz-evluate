It seems like you're describing an artistic or conceptual representation rather than a mathematical one. In mathematics, a poset (partially ordered set) is a set equipped with a binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. A "splitting element" in this context would refer to an element that can be split into two distinct elements without violating the properties of the poset.

However, your description of a black and white depiction of a man with dots representing his body parts and connections between them suggests a more visual or artistic interpretation. This could be a diagram used in dance notation, where each dot represents a specific body part and the lines connecting them represent the relationships or movements between those parts during a dance pose.

If you have any specific questions about posets or the artistic representation you described, feel free to ask!
