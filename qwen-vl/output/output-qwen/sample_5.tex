It seems like you're describing a visual representation of mathematical concepts, specifically related to filtrations and their duals in algebraic topology or category theory. However, the description of the image as "a black and white picture of a triangular pattern" doesn't provide enough detail for me to interpret it directly.

If you could provide more context or details about what you're trying to convey with this image, I'd be happy to help further. For example:

1. **Filtrations and Cofiltrations**: In mathematics, particularly in algebraic topology, a filtration on a space X is a sequence of subspaces \(X_0 \subseteq X_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n = X\). The dual concept, a cofiltration, would be a sequence of superspaces \(X_n \supseteq X_{n-1} \supseteq \cdots \supseteq X_1 \supseteq X_0\) where each \(X_i\) is a subspace of \(X_{i+1}\).

2. **Triangular Pattern**: A triangular pattern might represent a way to visualize these filtrations or cofiltrations. For instance, if you have a filtration \(X_0 \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2\), you could think of it as a triangle where the vertices represent the spaces \(X_0\), \(X_1\), and \(X_2\), and the edges represent the inclusions between them.

If you can provide more specific details about the image or the context in which you encountered this, I can offer a more precise interpretation or explanation.
