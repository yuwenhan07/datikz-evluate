It seems like you're describing a simple coordinate plane setup with two lines representing the axes. However, there's a bit of confusion in your description. Typically, a coordinate plane has one horizontal line (the x-axis) and one vertical line (the y-axis), but you mentioned "two white lines" which might be referring to the x-axis and y-axis themselves.

Hereâ€™s a clearer breakdown:

- **Left Image**: This is likely showing the x-axis, which runs horizontally from left to right.
- **Right Image**: This is likely showing the y-axis, which runs vertically from bottom to top.

In a standard coordinate plane:
- The x-axis is the horizontal line that goes from negative infinity to positive infinity.
- The y-axis is the vertical line that also goes from negative infinity to positive infinity.

Both axes intersect at the origin (0,0).

If you have specific questions about these lines or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
