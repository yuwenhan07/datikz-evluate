It seems like you're describing a visual representation of a mathematical concept, specifically a non-symmetric clique. A non-symmetric clique refers to a type of graph where not all vertices have the same degree (number of edges connected to them). In this case, the schematic view shows a series of equations arranged in a circular pattern, which could represent a system of equations or a sequence of transformations.

The equations are presented in a clear and organized manner, with each pair of adjacent equations occupying one section of the circle. This layout can be useful for understanding the relationships between different equations or steps in a process. If you have specific questions about the equations or the concept of a non-symmetric clique, feel free to ask!
