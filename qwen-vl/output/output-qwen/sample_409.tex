The description you've provided seems to be describing an image where the main subject is a white building against a black background, with the building's wall having a pattern of horizontal lines or stripes. This kind of visual composition can be quite striking due to the contrast between the white building and the dark background.

If you're looking for more information about interval chains in this context, it might be helpful to clarify what you mean by "interval chain." In mathematics, particularly in the field of number theory, an interval chain refers to a sequence of intervals (sets of numbers) that are nested within each other. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this term is being used metaphorically or literally in relation to the image you described.

If you have any specific questions about the image or need further analysis, feel free to ask!
