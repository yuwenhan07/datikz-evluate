It seems like you're describing a visual representation involving two rectangles, one smaller and one larger, with their respective heights denoted as \( h_1 \) and \( h_2 \). Based on your description:

- The smaller rectangle (let's call it \( H_1 \)) has a height of 2.
- The larger rectangle (let's call it \( H_2 \)) has a height of 3.

The problem also mentions "subproblem A_i" which is shown in shade. However, without more context or a specific question about this setup, I can summarize the information given:

1. There are two rectangles: one with height \( h_1 = 2 \) and another with height \( h_2 = 3 \).
2. These rectangles are placed on a white background.
3. The shaded area represents a subproblem labeled \( A_i \).

If you have a specific question related to these rectangles or the subproblem \( A_i \), please provide more details so I can assist you further.
