The image you've described sounds like it could be a visual representation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which is commonly used in computer science to represent a series of tasks or steps that need to be executed in a specific order. In the context of optimization algorithms, such as the Newton method for solving systems of nonlinear equations, a DAG can be used to illustrate the dependencies and the sequence of operations required to perform a single Newton step.

In a Newton step, the algorithm typically involves several key components:

1. **Compute the Jacobian Matrix**: This matrix represents the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable.
2. **Compute the Function Values**: Evaluate the original function at the current point.
3. **Solve the Linear System**: Solve the linear system given by \( J(x) \cdot \Delta x = -f(x) \), where \( J(x) \) is the Jacobian matrix, \( \Delta x \) is the change in variables, and \( f(x) \) is the vector of function values.
4. **Update the Variables**: Update the variables using \( x_{\text{new}} = x_{\text{old}} + \Delta x \).

A DAG for a single Newton step might look something like this:

- **Node 1**: Compute the Jacobian Matrix (\( J(x) \))
- **Node 2**: Compute the Function Values (\( f(x) \))
- **Node 3**: Solve the Linear System (\( J(x) \cdot \Delta x = -f(x) \))
- **Node 4**: Update the Variables (\( x_{\text{new}} = x_{\text{old}} + \Delta x \))

The lines connecting these nodes would show the dependencies:
- Node 1 depends on the current point \( x \).
- Node 2 depends on the current point \( x \).
- Node 3 depends on both the Jacobian matrix from Node 1 and the function values from Node 2.
- Node 4 depends on the solution from Node 3.

This DAG helps visualize the sequence of operations and the dependencies between them, ensuring that the algorithm proceeds correctly without skipping any necessary steps. It's a useful tool for understanding the computational flow and for identifying potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization in the implementation of the Newton method.
