To simplify the drawing of this puzzle using TikZ, you can create a grid and place the tiles accordingly. Below is an example of how you can draw the puzzle using TikZ:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    % Draw the grid
    \draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (6,3);
    
    % Draw the border
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (6,3);
    
    % Place the tiles
