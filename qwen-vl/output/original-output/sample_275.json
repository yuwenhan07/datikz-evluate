  "response": "Creating a state diagram for the `ACADL ExecuteStage` class involves representing the different states that the stage can be in and the transitions between those states. Since you've mentioned that `fu` (Functional Units) and `ps` (Pipeline Stages) are involved, we'll assume that the `ExecuteStage` is part of a larger pipeline system where it interacts with these components.\n\nHere's a simple state diagram representation using a textual format:\n\n```\n+-------------------+\n|  Initial State    |\n+-------------------+\n         |\n         v\n+-------------------+\n|  Waiting for fu   |\n+-------------------+\n         |\n         v\n+-------------------+\n|  Executing fu     |\n+-------------------+\n         |\n         v\n+-------------------+\n|  Waiting for ps   |\n+-------------------+\n         |\n         v\n+-------------------+\n|  Executed        |\n+-------------------+\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initial State**: The stage starts in an initial state.\n2. **Waiting for fu**: The stage waits for one of the functional units (`fu`) to become available.\n3. **Executing fu**: Once a functional unit becomes available, the stage starts executing the operation on that functional unit.\n4. **Waiting for ps**: After the execution is complete, the stage waits for the next pipeline stage (`ps`) to become ready.\n5. **Executed**: Finally, the stage completes its execution and transitions to the executed state.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Transitions**: The transitions between states would depend on specific conditions such as availability of functional units or pipeline stages.\n- **Events**: Events like \"functional unit becomes available,\" \"pipeline stage becomes ready,\" etc., trigger the transitions between states.\n- **Error Handling**: Depending on the design, there might be additional states for error handling, such as \"Error\" or \"Retry.\"\n\nIf you need a more detailed or graphical representation, you can use tools like PlantUML, which allows you to create state diagrams with precise details and transitions. Here’s a basic example using PlantUML:\n\n```plantuml\n@startuml\nstate Initial {\n    initial\n}\n\nstate WaitingForFU {\n    transition to ExecutingFU on \"fu becomes available\"\n}\n\nstate ExecutingFU {\n    transition to WaitingForPS on \"fu completes execution\"\n}\n\nstate WaitingForPS {\n    transition to Executed on \"ps becomes ready\"\n}\n\nstate Executed {\n    final\n}\n\n@enduml\n```\n\nThis PlantUML code will generate a state diagram similar to the one described above. You can further customize it based on your specific requirements and the interactions within the ACADL framework.",
