  "prompt": "A game of Tic-Tac-Toe{} played on a standard $3\\times 3$ board. The winning hyperedges and the state of a proposed game are also given.",
  "response": "To solve the problem of determining the winner in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, we need to analyze the given state of the board and check for any winning conditions. A standard Tic-Tac-Toe game is played on a \\(3 \\times 3\\) grid, and the player who gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.\n\nLet's assume the state of the board is given as follows (using 'X' for one player and 'O' for the other):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nX & O & X \\\\\n\\hline\nO & X & O \\\\\n\\hline\nX & O & X \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWe will check each possible winning condition:\n\n1. **Horizontal rows:**\n   - Row 1: \\(X, O, X\\) (No win)\n   - Row 2: \\(O, X, O\\) (No win)\n   - Row 3: \\(X, O, X\\) (No win)\n\n2. **Vertical columns:**\n   - Column 1: \\(X, O, X\\) (No win)\n   - Column 2: \\(O, X, O\\) (No win)\n   - Column 3: \\(X, O, X\\) (No win)\n\n3. **Diagonal lines:**\n   - Main diagonal: \\(X, X, X\\) (Win for player X)\n   - Other diagonal: \\(O, X, O\\) (No win)\n\nSince there is a win on the main diagonal for player X, the winner of the game is player X.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{X}\\).",
