  "prompt": "Each vertex $j$ for $2^k-1\\le j\\le 2^{k+1}-2$ may be reached in exactly $k$ steps.",
  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the graph and how vertices can be reached from each other. The problem statement suggests that each vertex \\( j \\) for \\( 2^k - 1 \\le j \\le 2^{k+1} - 2 \\) can be reached in exactly \\( k \\) steps. This implies that the graph is structured in such a way that it forms a specific type of tree or network where each level of the tree has a certain number of vertices and the distance between any two vertices at different levels is consistent.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the range of vertices**: The vertices \\( j \\) are in the range \\( 2^k - 1 \\le j \\le 2^{k+1} - 2 \\). This means there are \\( 2^{k+1} - (2^k - 1) = 2^k + 1 \\) vertices in this range.\n\n2. **Understand the structure**: The problem states that each vertex in this range can be reached in exactly \\( k \\) steps. This suggests that the graph is a binary tree where each level has a power of 2 vertices, and the distance between any two vertices at different levels is exactly \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Verify the structure**: In a binary tree, the distance between the root and any leaf node at depth \\( k \\) is exactly \\( k \\). The vertices in the range \\( 2^k - 1 \\le j \\le 2^{k+1} - 2 \\) correspond to the leaves of the tree at depth \\( k \\). Therefore, each vertex in this range can indeed be reached in exactly \\( k \\) steps from the root.\n\nThus, the structure of the graph must be a binary tree with \\( 2^{k+1} \\) vertices, where the vertices \\( 2^k - 1 \\) to \\( 2^{k+1} - 2 \\) are the leaves at depth \\( k \\). The distance from the root to any of these leaves is exactly \\( k \\).\n\nThe answer to the problem is that the graph must be a binary tree with the specified properties. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The graph is a binary tree with } 2^{k+1} \\text{ vertices.}}\n\\]",
