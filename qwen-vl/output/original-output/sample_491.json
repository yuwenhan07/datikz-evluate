  "response": "To understand and visualize the graph of the right-continuous step function \\(\\alpha(E_{p/q}^{\\boxtimes 3})\\) for \\(p/q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [2,3)\\) with discontinuity points as described in \\autoref{th:symm-disc}, we need to break down the problem into several steps.\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\(\\alpha\\)**:\n   - The function \\(\\alpha\\) is a step function that takes values based on the rational number \\(p/q\\) in the interval \\([2, 3)\\).\n   - Since \\(p/q\\) is a rational number in this interval, it can be expressed as a fraction where the denominator \\(q\\) is an integer and the numerator \\(p\\) is such that \\(2 \\leq p < q\\).\n\n2. **Discontinuity Points**:\n   - The discontinuity points of \\(\\alpha\\) are given by \\autoref{th:symm-disc}. These points are specific rational numbers in the interval \\([2, 3)\\) where the value of \\(\\alpha\\) changes abruptly.\n   - For simplicity, let's assume that the discontinuity points are known and listed. Let's denote these points as \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\).\n\n3. **Step Function Behavior**:\n   - Between any two consecutive discontinuity points, the function \\(\\alpha\\) is constant. This means that if \\(x_i < x < x_{i+1}\\), then \\(\\alpha(x) = c_i\\) for some constant \\(c_i\\).\n   - At each discontinuity point \\(x_i\\), the function \\(\\alpha\\) jumps from one constant value to another. Specifically, \\(\\alpha(x_i^-) = c_i\\) and \\(\\alpha(x_i^+) = c_{i+1}\\), where \\(c_i\\) and \\(c_{i+1}\\) are the constants just before and after the jump at \\(x_i\\).\n\n4. **Constructing the Graph**:\n   - To construct the graph, we plot the function \\(\\alpha\\) piecewise constant between the discontinuity points.\n   - For each interval \\((x_i, x_{i+1})\\), draw a horizontal line segment at height \\(c_i\\).\n   - At each discontinuity point \\(x_i\\), draw a vertical jump from height \\(c_i\\) to height \\(c_{i+1}\\).\n\n5. **Example**:\n   - Suppose the discontinuity points are \\(x_1 = 2.25\\), \\(x_2 = 2.5\\), and \\(x_3 = 2.75\\). Then the function \\(\\alpha\\) would have the following behavior:\n     - For \\(2 \\leq x < 2.25\\), \\(\\alpha(x) = c_1\\).\n     - For \\(2.25 \\leq x < 2.5\\), \\(\\alpha(x) = c_2\\).\n     - For \\(2.5 \\leq x < 2.75\\), \\(\\alpha(x) = c_3\\).\n     - For \\(2.75 \\leq x < 3\\), \\(\\alpha(x) = c_4\\).\n   - At \\(x = 2.25\\), there is a jump from \\(c_1\\) to \\(c_2\\).\n   - At \\(x = 2.5\\), there is a jump from \\(c_2\\) to \\(c_3\\).\n   - At \\(x = 2.75\\), there is a jump from \\(c_3\\) to \\(c_4\\).\n\nThe final answer, in terms of a description of the graph, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The graph consists of horizontal line segments between the discontinuity points, with vertical jumps at each discontinuity point.}}\n\\]\n\nThis description captures the essence of the step function \\(\\alpha\\) with the specified properties.",
