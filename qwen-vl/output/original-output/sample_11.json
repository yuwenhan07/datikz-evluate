  "prompt": "Strategy for establishing the $N$-extendibility of the thermal-noise-channel. The initial state $\\rho$ is amplified and split into $N$ modes using a beam splitter.",
  "response": "To establish the \\( N \\)-extendibility of the thermal-noise-channel, we need to understand what it means for a channel to be \\( N \\)-extendible. A quantum channel is said to be \\( N \\)-extendible if there exists an extension of the channel to a larger system that can be decomposed into \\( N \\) independent copies of the original channel.\n\nGiven that the initial state \\(\\rho\\) is amplified and split into \\( N \\) modes using a beam splitter, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Amplification**: The thermal-noise-channel typically involves the addition of thermal noise to the input state. This can be modeled as a quantum channel that adds a certain amount of thermal noise to the input state. For simplicity, let's assume the thermal-noise-channel is a depolarizing channel with a certain probability \\( p \\).\n\n2. **Beam Splitter**: A beam splitter is a device that splits a quantum state into two modes. In the context of quantum information theory, a beam splitter can be used to create entanglement between the modes. However, in this problem, we are only splitting the state into \\( N \\) modes without creating entanglement (i.e., the modes are not entangled with each other).\n\n3. **Splitting the State**: If the initial state \\(\\rho\\) is split into \\( N \\) modes using a beam splitter, then the state after the beam splitter will be a tensor product of \\( N \\) copies of the state \\(\\rho\\). That is, if the initial state is \\(\\rho\\), then after the beam splitter, the state becomes \\(\\rho^{\\otimes N}\\).\n\n4. **\\( N \\)-Extendibility**: To check if the thermal-noise-channel is \\( N \\)-extendible, we need to see if there exists an extension of the channel such that the output state after the extension can be decomposed into \\( N \\) independent copies of the original state. In this case, since the beam splitter simply splits the state into \\( N \\) modes without any additional interaction or entanglement, the state \\(\\rho^{\\otimes N}\\) is already in the form of \\( N \\) independent copies of the state \\(\\rho\\).\n\nTherefore, the thermal-noise-channel is \\( N \\)-extendible because the state \\(\\rho^{\\otimes N}\\) is already in the form of \\( N \\) independent copies of the state \\(\\rho\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{N}\n\\]",
