  "response": "To illustrate Riemannian optimization on a 2-dimensional torus (\\(\\mathbb{T}_2\\)), we need to understand the key components: the manifold, the tangent space, the retraction, and the descent direction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Illustration:\n\n1. **Manifold Representation**:\n   - The 2-dimensional torus \\(\\mathbb{T}_2\\) can be visualized as a doughnut shape embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). It is a compact, connected, and orientable surface without boundary.\n   - Points on the torus can be parameterized using two angles \\((\\theta_1, \\theta_2)\\) where \\(0 \\leq \\theta_1 < 2\\pi\\) and \\(0 \\leq \\theta_2 < 2\\pi\\).\n\n2. **Tangent Space**:\n   - At any point \\(\\mathbf{w} = (\\theta_1, \\theta_2)\\) on the torus, the tangent space \\(T_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbb{T}_2\\) consists of all possible directions one can move along the surface while staying on the torus.\n   - A tangent vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2)\\) at \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) can be thought of as a velocity field that describes how the point moves infinitesimally on the torus.\n\n3. **Descent Direction**:\n   - In Riemannian optimization, we seek a direction \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_t \\in T_{\\mathbf{w}_t} \\mathbb{T}_2\\) that points downhill in some sense. This direction is typically computed by solving an optimization problem over the tangent space.\n   - For simplicity, let's assume we have computed such a direction \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_t\\).\n\n4. **Retraction**:\n   - The retraction \\(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbf{w}_t}\\) is a map that takes a tangent vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_t\\) at \\(\\mathbf{w}_t\\) and \"pushes\" it back onto the manifold \\(\\mathbb{T}_2\\), resulting in a new point \\(\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\\).\n   - The retraction is designed to preserve the geometric properties of the manifold, ensuring that the new point \\(\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\\) lies on the torus.\n\n5. **Iterative Process**:\n   - Start with an initial point \\(\\mathbf{w}_0\\) on the torus.\n   - Compute the descent direction \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_t\\) at \\(\\mathbf{w}_t\\).\n   - Apply the retraction \\(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbf{w}_t}\\) to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_t\\) to obtain the new point \\(\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\\).\n   - Repeat the process until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.\n\n### Visualization:\n\nTo visualize this process, imagine starting at a point on the torus, say \\(\\mathbf{w}_0 = (0, 0)\\). Suppose you compute a descent direction \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_0\\) pointing slightly clockwise and counterclockwise (to account for the periodicity of the torus).\n\n- The retraction \\(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbf{w}_0}\\) will push \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_0\\) back onto the torus, resulting in a new point \\(\\mathbf{w}_1\\).\n- Continue this process iteratively, computing descent directions and applying retractions, until the sequence of points converges to a stationary point on the torus.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe illustration of Riemannian optimization on \\(\\mathbb{T}_2\\) involves:\n- Starting at a point \\(\\mathbf{w}_0\\).\n- Computing a descent direction \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_t\\) at each step.\n- Applying the retraction \\(\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathbf{w}_t}\\) to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_t\\) to obtain the next point \\(\\mathbf{w}_{t+1}\\).\n- Repeating the process until convergence.\n\nThis iterative procedure ensures that the optimization respects the intrinsic geometry of the torus, leading to efficient and accurate solutions.",
