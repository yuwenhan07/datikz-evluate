  "prompt": "We show an overview of our method, Forecasting Model Search (FMS), which builds on DyHPO's multifidelity method from Algorithm~\\ref{alg:dyhpo}. Novel components of FMS are highlighted in {\\color{blue}blue} and further detailed in Algorithm~\\ref{alg:fms}. We include DyHPO's features from the hyperparameter configuration, budget, and learning curve \\cite{wistuba2023supervising}. Notably, we also featurize the model's checkpointed weights $\\mathbf{W}$ with a permutation-invariant graph metanetwork (PIGMN) as in Section~\\ref{pigms} for input to a deep kernel GP (see Equation~\\ref{deepkernelgp}/\\ref{eq:weight_kernel}). This provides the HPO with an -- often pre-existing -- rich source of information, which implicitly includes the architecture, dataset, loss, and optimization process. FMS shows improved predictions about hyperparameter performance across compute budgets (see Table~\\ref{ktau-values}), improved quality of the final selected configuration across compute budgets (see Figure~\\ref{fig:regret_over_time}), and a potential to generalize beyond what was seen in training (see Figure~\\ref{fig:fms-transfer}). Specific design choices for this surrogate model are detailed in Appendix Section~\\ref{meta-hyperparams}.",
