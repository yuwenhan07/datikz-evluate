  "response": "To provide an example of a weighted graph \\( G \\) used in Theorem~\\ref{thm:np-complete}, we need to understand the context of the theorem. Typically, such a theorem might involve transforming a problem from one graph structure to another, often involving the concept of vertex cover or independent set, which are known NP-complete problems.\n\nLet's consider a simple example where we start with an unweighted graph \\( H \\) and then add weights to it to form a weighted graph \\( G \\). We'll use this transformation to show that the problem remains NP-complete.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Unweighted Graph \\( H \\)\nConsider the following unweighted graph \\( H \\):\n\\[ H = (V_H, E_H) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( V_H = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\} \\)\n- \\( E_H = \\{\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_2, v_3\\}, \\{v_3, v_4\\}\\} \\)\n\nThis is a path graph with 4 vertices and 3 edges.\n\n### Step 2: Add Weighted Vertices and Edges\nWe will add some additional vertices and edges to \\( H \\) to form the weighted graph \\( G \\). Let's assume we add a new vertex \\( u \\) and edges connecting \\( u \\) to each of the vertices in \\( H \\), with each edge having a weight equal to the size of the vertex set \\( U \\).\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume \\( U = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\} \\), so the weight of each edge \\( \\{u, v_i\\} \\) is 3 (since \\( |U| = 3 \\)).\n\nThe resulting weighted graph \\( G \\) will be:\n\\[ G = (V_G, E_G) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( V_G = V_H \\cup \\{u\\} = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, u\\} \\)\n- \\( E_G = E_H \\cup \\{\\{u, v_1\\}, \\{u, v_2\\}, \\{u, v_3\\}, \\{u, v_4\\}\\} \\)\n\nEach edge \\( \\{u, v_i\\} \\) has a weight of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Transformation and NP-Completeness\nThe transformation involves adding the vertex \\( u \\) and the edges \\( \\{u, v_i\\} \\) with weight 3. This transformation is designed to maintain the NP-completeness of the problem because the original problem (e.g., vertex cover or independent set) on the unweighted graph \\( H \\) is transformed into a problem on the weighted graph \\( G \\) that retains its NP-completeness.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe weighted graph \\( G \\) is constructed by adding a single vertex \\( u \\) and edges from \\( u \\) to each vertex in \\( H \\), each with a weight of 3. This construction ensures that the problem remains NP-complete, as the addition of weights does not change the fundamental nature of the problem being solved.\n\nThus, the example of the weighted graph \\( G \\) is:\n\\[ G = (V_G, E_G) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( V_G = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, u\\} \\)\n- \\( E_G = \\{\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_2, v_3\\}, \\{v_3, v_4\\}, \\{u, v_1\\}, \\{u, v_2\\}, \\{u, v_3\\}, \\{u, v_4\\}\\} \\)\n- Each edge \\( \\{u, v_i\\} \\) has a weight of 3.\n\nThis example demonstrates how a simple transformation can be used to prove the NP-completeness of a problem by maintaining the core structure while introducing weights.",
