  "prompt": "Illustration of Newton's method in 1 variable case, aiming to find the root of the nonlinear equation $f(x) = 0.5x^2 - 3x +4$. First we initialize the guessed solution $x_0$. The tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x_0$ intersects the $x$-axis at the point $x_1$, which is the updated solution. The procedure is then iterated multiple times until the real root is found, or at least a desired approximation is reached. We note that since the equation might have more than 1 solution, the initialization is critical as the method would drive toward the closest root. On the same figure, we can see that if initially we begin at $x_m$ (on the left), then we end up with different root.",
