  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the concept of the counting measure \\(\\mu_X\\) associated with the set \\(X\\), which consists of four points on the edges of a square in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).\n\nThe counting measure \\(\\mu_X\\) is defined as follows:\n- For any subset \\(A\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), \\(\\mu_X(A)\\) is the number of points in \\(X\\) that lie in \\(A\\).\n- If no point in \\(X\\) lies in \\(A\\), then \\(\\mu_X(A) = 0\\).\n\nLet's denote the four points in \\(X\\) as \\(P_1, P_2, P_3,\\) and \\(P_4\\). Since these points are on the edges of a square, each point can be thought of as lying on one of the four sides of the square.\n\nThe counting measure \\(\\mu_X\\) will count the number of times each point appears in any given subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). Specifically, if a subset \\(A\\) intersects the square at exactly one of these points, then \\(\\mu_X(A) = 1\\). If it intersects at two or more points, then \\(\\mu_X(A)\\) will be the number of points in \\(A\\) that are in \\(X\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(A\\) is a subset of the square that contains only one of the points \\(P_1, P_2, P_3,\\) or \\(P_4\\), then \\(\\mu_X(A) = 1\\). If \\(A\\) contains two of these points, say \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\), then \\(\\mu_X(A) = 2\\). If \\(A\\) contains all four points, then \\(\\mu_X(A) = 4\\).\n\nIn general, for any subset \\(A\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), \\(\\mu_X(A)\\) is simply the number of points in \\(X\\) that lie in \\(A\\).\n\nTherefore, the counting measure \\(\\mu_X\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\mu_X(A) = \\text{number of points in } X \\text{ that lie in } A}\n\\]",
