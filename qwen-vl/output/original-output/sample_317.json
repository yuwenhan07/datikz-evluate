  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the concepts of triangulation and snake graphs in the context of a pentagon. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Triangulation of a Pentagon:**\n   A triangulation of a pentagon is a way to divide the pentagon into triangles using non-intersecting diagonals. A pentagon can be triangulated into 3 triangles. One possible triangulation is shown below:\n\n   ```\n   /\\\n  /  \\\n /    \\\n/      \\\n\\      /\n \\    /\n  \\  /\n   \\/\n```\n\n2. **Snake Graph of the Longest Arc:**\n   The snake graph of an arc in a triangulation is a graph that represents the sequence of arcs obtained by repeatedly flipping the arc in question. The longest arc in a triangulation of a pentagon is the one that spans two vertices directly connected by a diagonal. For the triangulation shown above, the longest arc is the one connecting the second vertex from the left to the fourth vertex from the left (let's call this arc \\( \\gamma \\)).\n\n   When we flip the arc \\( \\gamma \\), we get a new triangulation where \\( \\gamma \\) is no longer present. We continue flipping until we return to the original triangulation. The sequence of triangulations obtained by these flips forms a snake graph.\n\n   For the triangulation shown above, the longest arc \\( \\gamma \\) connects vertices 2 and 4. Flipping \\( \\gamma \\) once gives us a new triangulation where \\( \\gamma \\) is replaced by two new arcs. Flipping again will return us to the original triangulation. The snake graph will have three nodes corresponding to the three different triangulations obtained by flipping \\( \\gamma \\).\n\n   The snake graph for the longest arc \\( \\gamma \\) in this case would look like this:\n\n   ```\n   s -> t -> s\n   ```\n\n   Here, \\( s \\) is the source triangulation and \\( t \\) is the target triangulation after flipping the arc \\( \\gamma \\). The arrow indicates the direction of the flip.\n\nSo, the snake graph of the longest arc \\( \\gamma \\) with source \\( s \\) and target \\( t \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{s \\rightarrow t}\n\\]",
