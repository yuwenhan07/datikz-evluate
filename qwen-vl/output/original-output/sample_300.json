  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the graph \\(\\mathcal{G}_j\\) for customer \\(j\\). The graph is defined over the set of locations \\(\\mathcal{I} = \\{1, 2\\}\\) and the set of time periods \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\{1, 2\\}\\), with the edge weights given by \\(a_{ij} = 1\\) for all \\(i \\in \\mathcal{I}\\).\n\nThe graph \\(\\mathcal{G}_j\\) will be a directed graph with two nodes (one for each location) and two time periods. Since \\(a_{ij} = 1\\) for all \\(i \\in \\mathcal{I}\\), there is a directed arc from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\) for each pair \\((i, j)\\) and each time period.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Nodes**: There are two nodes, one for each location, say Node 1 and Node 2.\n2. **Arcs**: For each time period, there is an arc from Node 1 to Node 2 and an arc from Node 2 to Node 1. This means there are four arcs in total:\n   - From Node 1 to Node 2 at time period 1.\n   - From Node 1 to Node 2 at time period 2.\n   - From Node 2 to Node 1 at time period 1.\n   - From Node 2 to Node 1 at time period 2.\n\nSince the problem specifies that solid arcs denote the path when the provider installs location 1 at time periods 1 and 2, we can infer that the arcs from Node 1 to Node 2 are the ones that are solid. Therefore, the solid arcs are:\n- From Node 1 to Node 2 at time period 1.\n- From Node 1 to Node 2 at time period 2.\n\nThe graph \\(\\mathcal{G}_j\\) can be represented as follows:\n\n```\nNode 1 -----> Node 2\n|           |\n|           |\nv           v\nNode 2 -----> Node 1\n```\n\nIn this representation, the solid arcs are the ones from Node 1 to Node 2 at both time periods. The dashed arcs represent the arcs from Node 2 to Node 1 at both time periods.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Node 1} \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\text{Node 2}\n\\end{array}\n\\quad\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Node 2} \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\text{Node 1}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]\n\nwhere the solid arcs are from Node 1 to Node 2 at both time periods.",
