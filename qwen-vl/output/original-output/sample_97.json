If \\( \\phi \\) is not injective, then there exist distinct elements \\( x, y \\in M \\) such that \\( \\phi(x) = \\phi(y) \\).\n   - Given the relation \\( ba = aa \\), any homomorphism must respect this relation. However, since \\( M \\) is generated by \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and the relation \\( ba = aa \\) does not introduce new elements beyond those already present in words consisting of \\( a \\)'s and \\( b \\)'s, any homomorphism must map \\( b \\) to an element that respects the relation when combined with \\( a \\).\n   - Since \\( M \\) is finite (it can be shown to be a finite monoid), any homomorphism from \\( M \\) to itself must be injective because there are no non-trivial relations that would allow for non-injective mappings.\n\n5. **Core \\( M_2 \\)**:\n   - The core \\( M_2 \\) likely refers to a specific submonoid or part of the monoid \\( M \\) that captures the essential structure of rank two.\n   - For a monoid of rank two, the core typically involves the interaction between the two generators \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe monoid \\( M = \\langle a, b \\mid ba = aa \\rangle \\) is up-hopfian because any homomorphism from \\( M \\) to itself must be injective due to the finite nature of the monoid and the constraints imposed by the relation \\( ba = aa \\).
