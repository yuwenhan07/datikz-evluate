  "response": "To create a plot of the number of successfully hidden payload bits against the length of the response, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Run the experiment 100 times for each response length and record the number of successfully hidden payload bits.\n2. **Data Organization**: Organize the data into a structured format where each row represents one trial and columns represent the response length and the number of successfully hidden payload bits.\n3. **Plotting**: Use a plotting library (such as Matplotlib in Python) to create a line plot or a bar plot.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide using Python and Matplotlib:\n\n### Step 1: Data Collection\n\nAssume you have collected the data in a list of lists, where each sublist contains the response length and the number of successfully hidden payload bits for that length. For example:\n\n```python\ndata = [\n    [10, 5],  # Response length 10, 5 successful hidden bits\n    [20, 8],  # Response length 20, 8 successful hidden bits\n    [30, 12], # Response length 30, 12 successful hidden bits\n    # ... more data ...\n]\n```\n\n### Step 2: Data Organization\n\nWe can organize this data into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and plotting.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Convert the list of lists to a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Response_Length', 'Hidden_Bits'])\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Plotting\n\nNow, we can use Matplotlib to create a line plot showing the number of successfully hidden payload bits against the response length.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Plot the data\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(df['Response_Length'], df['Hidden_Bits'], marker='o')\nplt.title('Number of Successfully Hidden Payload Bits vs. Response Length')\nplt.xlabel('Response Length')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Successfully Hidden Payload Bits')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Data Collection**: We assume the data is already collected and stored in a list of lists.\n- **Data Organization**: We convert the list of lists into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling.\n- **Plotting**: We use Matplotlib to create a line plot. The `plot` function takes the response length as the x-axis and the number of successfully hidden payload bits as the y-axis. The `marker='o'` argument adds markers at each point on the plot.\n\nThis will give you a clear visual representation of how the number of successfully hidden payload bits changes with the length of the response.",
