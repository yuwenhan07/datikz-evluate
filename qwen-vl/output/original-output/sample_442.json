The formula is a conjunction of three clauses, and each clause represents a disjunction of literals. In a graph, this corresponds to a set of edges where each edge connects two variables that appear together in a clause.\n\nLet's break down the formula:\n\n1. The first clause is \\(X_1 \\vee X_3\\). This means that if either \\(X_1\\) or \\(X_3\\) is true, then the clause is satisfied. In terms of a graph, this means there is an edge between \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_3\\).\n2. The second clause is \\(X_2 \\vee X_3 \\vee X_5\\). This means that if any one of \\(X_2\\), \\(X_3\\), or \\(X_5\\) is true, then the clause is satisfied. In terms of a graph, this means there is an edge between \\(X_2\\) and \\(X_3\\), an edge between \\(X_2\\) and \\(X_5\\), and an edge between \\(X_3\\) and \\(X_5\\).\n3. The third clause is \\(X_4 \\vee X_5\\). This means that if either \\(X_4\\) or \\(X_5\\) is true, then the clause is satisfied. In terms of a graph, this means there is an edge between \\(X_4\\) and \\(X_5\\).\n\nCombining all these edges, the graph \\(G_{\\mathcal{F}}\\) will have the following edges:\n- An edge between \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_3\\)\n- An edge between \\(X_2\\) and \\(X_3\\)\n- An edge between \\(X_2\\) and \\(X_5\\)\n- An edge between \\(X_3\\) and \\(X_5\\)\n- An edge between \\(X_4\\) and \\(X_5\\)\n\nThus, the graph \\(G_{\\mathcal{F}}\\) is a complete bipartite graph \\(K_{2,3}\\) with vertices partitioned into two sets: \\(\\{X_1, X_2, X_4\\}\\) and \\(\\{X_3, X_5\\}\\). The edges are as follows:\n- Between \\(\\{X_1, X_2, X_4\\}\\) and \\(\\{X_3, X_5\\}\\)\n\nSo, the graph \\(G_{\\mathcal{F}}\\) can be represented as:\n\\[ G_{\\mathcal{F}} = K_{2,3} \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{K_{2,3}}\n\\]",
