  "prompt": "Illustration of the passageway environment. The agent moves within the black walls, starting from the blue tile, it must reach the red switches to open the gray doors, and reach the final green position.",
  "response": "To create an illustration of the passageway environment as described, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw the Walls**: Start by drawing the black walls that form the boundaries of the passageway. These walls should be continuous and enclose the entire area.\n\n2. **Mark the Tiles**: Within the walls, mark the tiles with different colors to represent their functions:\n   - Blue tile: This is where the agent starts.\n   - Red switches: These are the points where the agent needs to interact to open the gray doors.\n   - Gray doors: These are the doors that need to be opened using the red switches.\n   - Green tile: This is the final position where the agent needs to reach.\n\n3. **Connect the Components**: Draw paths or corridors between the tiles, ensuring that the agent can move from one tile to another. The paths should be clear and unobstructed except for the doors which need to be opened.\n\n4. **Label the Components**: Clearly label each component (blue tile, red switches, gray doors, and green tile) to make it easy to understand the layout.\n\nHere is a textual representation of the illustration:\n\n```\n+-------------------+\n|                   |\n|  B                |\n|                   |\n|  R S             |\n|                   |\n|  G               |\n|                   |\n+-------------------+\n```\n\n- `B` represents the blue tile where the agent starts.\n- `R S` represents the red switches that need to be pressed to open the gray doors.\n- `G` represents the green tile where the agent needs to reach the final position.\n\nThe actual illustration would look something like this:\n\n```\n+-------------------+\n|                   |\n|  B                |\n|                   |\n|  R S             |\n|                   |\n|  G               |\n|                   |\n+-------------------+\n```\n\nIn this illustration:\n- The blue tile (`B`) is at the top left corner.\n- The red switches (`R S`) are in the middle row.\n- The gray doors are not shown but are implied to be behind the red switches.\n- The green tile (`G`) is at the bottom right corner.\n\nThis setup ensures that the agent can start at the blue tile, press the red switches to open the gray doors, and then move to the green tile to complete the task.",
