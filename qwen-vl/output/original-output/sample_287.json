  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the tree \\( T \\) and its third power \\( T^3 \\), as well as the concept of a metric basis.\n\n1. **Understanding the Tree \\( T \\)**:\n   - A tree \\( T \\) is a connected graph with no cycles.\n   - The third power of a tree \\( T^3 \\) is a graph where two vertices are adjacent if their distance in \\( T \\) is at most 3.\n   - The metric basis of a graph is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in the graph is uniquely determined by their distances to the vertices in the set.\n\n2. **Metric Basis**:\n   - For a tree \\( T \\), the metric basis is typically the set of leaves (end vertices) because they provide the maximum number of pairwise distances.\n   - For the third power \\( T^3 \\), the metric basis must be chosen such that it can uniquely determine all pairs of vertices in \\( T^3 \\).\n\n3. **Red Vertices as Metric Basis**:\n   - The red vertices form the metric basis of \\( T \\).\n   - Since \\( T \\) is a tree, the metric basis of \\( T \\) is the set of leaves of \\( T \\). If \\( T \\) has \\( n \\) leaves, then the metric basis of \\( T \\) is exactly these \\( n \\) leaves.\n\n4. **Blue Vertices**:\n   - The blue vertices are extra inserted to form a metric basis of \\( T^3 \\).\n   - To form a metric basis for \\( T^3 \\), we need to ensure that the distances between all pairs of vertices in \\( T^3 \\) can be uniquely determined by the distances to the vertices in the metric basis.\n   - Since \\( T \\) has \\( n \\) leaves, the metric basis of \\( T \\) is \\( n \\) vertices. For \\( T^3 \\), we need to consider the structure of \\( T^3 \\) and how the distances are affected by the additional edges introduced by the third power.\n\n5. **Case Analysis**:\n   - If \\( n \\) is odd, the red vertices alone might not form a metric basis for \\( T^3 \\) because the additional edges in \\( T^3 \\) can introduce new distances that are not uniquely determined by the red vertices alone.\n   - Therefore, we need to add some blue vertices to the red vertices to form a metric basis for \\( T^3 \\).\n   - If \\( n \\) is even, the red vertices alone might form a metric basis for \\( T^3 \\) because the additional edges in \\( T^3 \\) do not introduce new distances that cannot be uniquely determined by the red vertices alone.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - When \\( n \\) is odd, the red vertices alone do not form a metric basis for \\( T^3 \\), so we need to add some blue vertices.\n   - When \\( n \\) is even, the red vertices alone form a metric basis for \\( T^3 \\), so we do not need to add any blue vertices.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The red vertices form the metric basis of } T \\text{ and the blue vertices are extra inserted to form a metric basis of } T^3.}\n\\]",
