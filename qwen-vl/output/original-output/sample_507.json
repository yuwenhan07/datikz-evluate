  "prompt": "Modular elastoplastic material modeling. The initial yielding can be fully DD or can separately include the equivalent stress measure and the yield stress. Hardening components can e.g. include the deformation resistance or some form of hardening moduli. See \\cite{vlassis2022component} and \\cite{fuhg2023modular}.",
  "response": "Modular elastoplastic material modeling is an advanced approach to describing the behavior of materials under various loading conditions, particularly in the context of structural engineering and materials science. This type of modeling allows for a more detailed and accurate representation of material properties by breaking down the overall response into distinct components that can be individually modeled.\n\n### Key Components of Modular Elastoplastic Material Modeling\n\n1. **Initial Yielding:**\n   - **Fully DD (Direct Displacement):** This refers to the initial yielding behavior where the material transitions from elastic to plastic deformation without any intermediate stages. The yield surface is defined directly in terms of displacement or strain.\n   - **Equivalent Stress Measure and Yield Stress:** In this approach, the yield condition is defined using an equivalent stress measure (such as von Mises or Tresca) combined with a yield stress. This allows for a more generalized description of yielding behavior across different stress states.\n\n2. **Hardening Components:**\n   - **Deformation Resistance:** This component models how the material's resistance to further deformation increases as it undergoes plastic deformation. It can be described through various hardening laws such as isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening, or mixed hardening.\n   - **Hardening Moduli:** These are parameters that describe the rate at which the material's yield strength increases with plastic deformation. They can be used to model different types of hardening behaviors, including linear, nonlinear, and even non-monotonic hardening.\n\n### References\n\n- **Vlassis, N., et al.
