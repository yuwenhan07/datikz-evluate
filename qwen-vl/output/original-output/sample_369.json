  "prompt": "A conceptual map demonstrating the context of the electron-mirror duality as the lower leg of a thermal-particle-creation triangle. The mathematical identity map between the classical/quantum model of the electron and mirror is exact. Since the moving mirror has a half-century history as a useful analog for black hole radiation, the least developed side of the triangle is the link between experimentally-challenging black holes and experimentation-friendly electrons. Our electron results explicitly demonstrate the duality's power, providing tractable means for investigating the classical quantum aspects of relativistic thermodynamics (a languishing field with a severe paucity of experimental evidence). Our solutions help to reorient the direction of inquiry and establish analytic examples that illustrate the `linographic' (physical content in 3D space is encoded in 1D space) utility of the electron-mirror duality.",
