  "prompt": "An example for our lower bound construction in Theorem~\\ref{thm:omega_log_m_lower_bound_non_stochastic} that illustrates the way in which the agents' valuations are defined. The alternative $\\widehat{a}$ picked by the mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ is marked as a black box in every agent's ranking. We assume that $\\mathcal{M}$ queried the positions corresponding to the dashed boxes. In this example, the mechanism only queries the first position in a bucket which is without loss of generality. The gray areas correspond to buckets in which all alternatives have high values. White areas correspond to buckets in which alternatives have low values, either because the bucket contains the winning alternative $\\widehat{a}$ or because mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ queried the value of an alternative in the bucket.",
  "response": "To provide a clear and detailed example for the lower bound construction in Theorem~\\ref{thm:omega_log_m_lower_bound_non_stochastic}, let's break down the scenario step-by-step.\n\n### Example Setup\n\n1. **Agents and Alternatives**: There are \\( n \\) agents and \\( m \\) alternatives.\n2. **Valuation Function**: Each agent has a valuation function \\( v_i(a) \\) for each alternative \\( a \\). The valuations are such that there exists a set of \"high-value\" buckets and \"low-value\" buckets.\n3. **Mechanism**: A mechanism \\( \\mathcal{M} \\) is designed to select an alternative \\( \\widehat{a} \\) based on the agents' reported valuations.\n4. **Querying Positions**: The mechanism queries the positions of some alternatives to estimate their valuations.\n\n### Example Illustration\n\n#### Step 1: Define the Buckets\n\n- **High-Value Buckets**: These are buckets where all alternatives have high values.\n- **Low-Value Buckets**: These are buckets where all alternatives have low values.\n- **Mixed Buckets**: These are buckets where the winning alternative (i.e., the one with the highest value) is not known yet, but the mechanism has queried the value of at least one alternative in the bucket.\n\n#### Step 2: Construct the Valuation Function\n\nConsider the following valuation function for simplicity:\n\n- **Agent 1**:\n  - High-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\} \\)\n  - Low-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_4, a_5, a_6\\} \\)\n\n- **Agent 2**:\n  - High-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_7, a_8, a_9\\} \\)\n  - Low-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}\\} \\)\n\n- **Agent 3**:\n  - High-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}\\} \\)\n  - Low-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}\\} \\)\n\n- **Agent 4**:\n  - High-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21}\\} \\)\n  - Low-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_{22}, a_{23}, a_{24}\\} \\)\n\n- **Agent 5**:\n  - High-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_{25}, a_{26}, a_{27}\\} \\)\n  - Low-Value Buckets: \\( \\{a_{28}, a_{29}, a_{30}\\} \\)\n\n### Step 3: Mechanism Querying\n\nThe mechanism \\( \\mathcal{M} \\) queries the positions of some alternatives to estimate their valuations.

In this example, the mechanism could pick any of the alternatives \\( a_1, a_7, a_{13}, a_{19}, a_{25} \\), but for simplicity, let's say it picks \\( a_1 \\).\n\nThis example illustrates how the mechanism queries the positions of alternatives to estimate their valuations and how the agents' valuations are structured into high-value and low-value buckets.
