  "response": "The iterated blowup of a \\( K_4 \\) (complete graph on 4 vertices) is a process where we repeatedly add new vertices and edges to the original graph in a specific way. Let's break down the process step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Initial Graph\nA \\( K_4 \\) is a complete graph with 4 vertices, meaning every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. So, \\( K_4 \\) has 6 edges.\n\n### Step 2: Iterated Blowup Process\nThe iterated blowup process involves adding new vertices and edges to the original graph. Specifically, for each vertex in the original graph, we replace it with a new vertex and connect this new vertex to all other vertices in the original graph. This process is repeated recursively.\n\n### Step 3: First Iteration\nFor the first iteration:\n- We take the 4 vertices of \\( K_4 \\).\n- For each of these 4 vertices, we add a new vertex.\n- Each of these new vertices is connected to all 3 remaining vertices in the original graph.\n\nThis results in a new graph with:\n- 4 original vertices + 4 new vertices = 8 vertices.\n- Each of the 4 original vertices is now connected to the 4 new vertices, so there are \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) edges added.\n\n### Step 4: Second Iteration\nFor the second iteration:\n- We now have 8 vertices from the previous step.\n- For each of these 8 vertices, we add a new vertex.\n- Each of these new vertices is connected to all 7 remaining vertices in the original graph.\n\nThis results in a new graph with:\n- 8 original vertices + 8 new vertices = 16 vertices.\n- Each of the 8 original vertices is now connected to the 8 new vertices, so there are \\( 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\) edges added.\n\n### Step 5: General Pattern\nIn general, after \\( n \\)-th iteration:\n- The number of vertices becomes \\( 4^n \\).\n- The number of edges added in the \\( n \\)-th iteration is \\( 4^{n-1} \\times 4^n = 4^{2n-1} \\).\n\n### Step 6: Thick Edges\nThe \"thick\" edges in the context you provided likely refer to the edges that are present in the original \\( K_4 \\). In the iterated blowup, these edges remain unchanged and are simply part of the structure of the graph at each stage.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe iterated blowup of a \\( K_4 \\) results in a graph with \\( 4^n \\) vertices and \\( 4^{2n-1} \\) edges added in the \\( n \\)-th iteration. The thick edges are the original edges of the \\( K_4 \\), which remain as part of the graph throughout the process.",
