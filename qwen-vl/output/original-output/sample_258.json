  "response": "To determine the maximal support and the Newton polytope of a degree 6 polynomial that has a zero of multiplicity 4 at \\((0,0)\\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Multiplicity Condition**: A zero of multiplicity \\(k\\) at \\((0,0)\\) means that the polynomial can be written in the form:\n   \\[\n   P(x,y) = x^4 Q(x,y)\n   \\]\n   where \\(Q(x,y)\\) is a polynomial of degree \\(2\\) (since \\(6 - 4 = 2\\)).\n\n2. **Form of the Polynomial**: The polynomial \\(P(x,y)\\) can thus be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P(x,y) = x^4 (a_{20} y^2 + a_{11} xy + a_{02} x^2)\n   \\]\n   where \\(a_{20}\\), \\(a_{11}\\), and \\(a_{02}\\) are constants, and \\(a_{20} \\neq 0\\) because the term \\(x^4 y^2\\) would not be present if \\(a_{20} = 0\\).\n\n3. **Newton Polytope**: The Newton polytope of a polynomial is the convex hull of the exponents of its monomials. For the polynomial \\(P(x,y) = x^4 (a_{20} y^2 + a_{11} xy + a_{02} x^2)\\), the exponents of the monomials are \\((4,0)\\), \\((3,1)\\), \\((2,2)\\), \\((4,1)\\), \\((3,2)\\), and \\((2,0)\\). The convex hull of these points is a triangle with vertices \\((4,0)\\), \\((3,1)\\), and \\((2,2)\\).\n\n4. **Maximal Support**: The maximal support of a polynomial is the set of all exponents of its monomials. For the polynomial \\(P(x,y) = x^4 (a_{20} y^2 + a_{11} xy + a_{02} x^2)\\), the maximal support is the set \\(\\{(4,0), (3,1), (2,2), (4,1), (3,2), (2,0)\\}\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximal support and the Newton polytope of the polynomial are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\{(4,0), (3,1), (2,2), (4,1), (3,2), (2,0)\\}, \\text{the triangle with vertices } (4,0), (3,1), (2,2)}\n\\]",
