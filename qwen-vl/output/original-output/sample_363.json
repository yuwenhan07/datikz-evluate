  "prompt": "Transition probability matrices for node (a), edge (b), and path ($l=2$) (c) hypotheses, where $w_h \\geq w_l > 0$ denote transition probabilities. $x_i$ represents nodes in $\\mathcal{G}$ satisfying the $i$-th node modifier on $\\mathcal{P}$, while $y$ represents nodes not satisfying any node modifier on $\\mathcal{P}$. (a) and (b) involve 1st-order random walks, whereas (c) involves 2nd-order random walks because the probability of selecting the next node depends on both the current and previous nodes.",
