  "response": "To understand the transitions from \\(\\sigma\\) to \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) used in the proof of Lemma \\ref{lemma:before_still_selected}, we need to carefully analyze the context and the specific steps involved in the proof. However, since the lemma and its proof are not provided in your question, I will assume that you are referring to a common type of proof in combinatorial optimization or graph theory where such transitions might be used.\n\nLet's consider a typical scenario where \\(\\sigma\\) represents an initial state (e.g., a permutation of vertices in a graph) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) represents a transformed state (e.g., a new permutation after some operation). The transitions could involve operations like swaps, insertions, deletions, or other transformations that preserve certain properties of the state.\n\nHere is a general outline of how such transitions might be used in a proof:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Start with the initial state \\(\\sigma\\), which could be any permutation of vertices in a graph.\n2. **Transformation Operation**: Apply a transformation operation to \\(\\sigma\\) to get a new state \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\). This operation could be something like:\n   - Swapping two elements in the permutation.\n   - Inserting an element at a specific position.\n   - Deleting an element from the permutation.\n   - Applying a specific rule or algorithm that transforms the permutation in a way that preserves certain properties.\n3. **Verification**: Verify that the transformation operation preserves the property of interest (e.g., the number of selected vertices remains the same).\n4. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume that for all states before the current transition, the property holds.\n5. **Conclusion**: Conclude that the property also holds for the new state \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\).\n\nFor example, if the lemma is about a selection process in a graph where the number of selected vertices is preserved through a series of operations, the transitions might look like this:\n\n- Let \\(\\sigma\\) be an initial permutation of vertices in a graph.\n- Apply a swap operation to \\(\\sigma\\) to get \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\).\n- Verify that the number of selected vertices in \\(\\sigma\\) is the same as in \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\).\n- Use induction to show that the number of selected vertices remains constant throughout the sequence of operations.\n\nWithout the specific lemma and its proof, it's difficult to provide a more detailed example. However, the general approach would be similar to the one outlined above.\n\nIf you can provide the exact lemma and its proof, I can give a more precise answer.",
