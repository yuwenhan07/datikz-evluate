  "response": "A Markov reward-on-edges process is a type of Markov chain where the transitions between states are not only probabilistic but also associated with rewards. In this context, we can represent the state transition diagram as follows:\n\n### States:\nLet's denote the states of the Markov chain as \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n \\).\n\n### Transitions and Rewards:\nEach transition from one state to another is labeled with a tuple \\((p_{ij}, r_j)\\), where:\n- \\( p_{ij} \\) is the probability of transitioning from state \\( i \\) to state \\( j \\).\n- \\( r_j \\) is the reward received upon transitioning to state \\( j \\).\n\n### State Transition Diagram:\nThe state transition diagram will have nodes representing each state \\( S_i \\) and directed edges connecting these nodes. Each edge will be labeled with the tuple \\((p_{ij}, r_j)\\).\n\nHereâ€™s how you might draw it:\n\n1. **Nodes**: Draw circles or nodes for each state \\( S_i \\).\n2. **Edges**: Draw directed arrows from node \\( S_i \\) to node \\( S_j \\) for each possible transition.\n3. **Labels on Edges**: Write the label \\((p_{ij}, r_j)\\) next to each arrow.\n\n### Example:\nSuppose we have three states: \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\).\n\n- From \\( S_1 \\):\n  - To \\( S_2 \\): Labelled as \\((0.5, 2)\\)\n  - To \\( S_3 \\): Labelled as \\((0.5, 3)\\)\n\n- From \\( S_2 \\):\n  - To \\( S_1 \\): Labelled as \\((0.6, 1)\\)\n  - To \\( S_3 \\): Labelled as \\((0.4, 4)\\)\n\n- From \\( S_3 \\):\n  - To \\( S_1 \\): Labelled as \\((0.7, 5)\\)\n  - To \\( S_2 \\): Labelled as \\((0.3, 6)\\)\n\nThe state transition diagram would look like this:\n\n```\nS1 -> S2 (0.5, 2) -> S3 (0.5, 3)\n     |\n     v\nS1 -> S2 (0.6, 1) -> S3 (0.4, 4)\n     |\n     v\nS1 -> S2 (0.7, 5) -> S3 (0.3, 6)\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n- The vertical lines represent the states.\n- The horizontal arrows represent the transitions.\n- The labels on the arrows indicate the probability of the transition and the reward received upon that transition.\n\nThis is a general representation. Depending on the specific problem, the number of states and the transitions may vary.",
