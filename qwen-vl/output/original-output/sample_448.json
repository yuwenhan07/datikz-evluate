  "prompt": "The figure illustrates a spanning $r$-arborescence $T$(bold arcs) in a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ (bold and gray arcs). The non-leaf vertices are marked in different colors and for each non-leaf, the leaving arcs are drawn in the same color. Moreover, colorful frames indicate the out-neighborhoods of the non-leafs. It can be seen that these form a partition of $V\\setminus \\{r\\}$. The number of leaves of $T$ can be calculated by summing up the colorful numbers written below the out-neighborhoods (cf.\\ \\cref{prop:number_of_leaves}).",
  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the spanning \\( r \\)-arborescence \\( T \\) in the directed graph \\( G = (V, E) \\). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Definition of Spanning \\( r \\)-Arborescence**: A spanning \\( r \\)-arborescence is a directed tree rooted at \\( r \\) such that every vertex in \\( V \\setminus \\{r\\} \\) has exactly one incoming arc from its parent in the tree.\n\n2. **Non-Leaf Vertices and Their Out-Neighborhoods**: Non-leaf vertices are those vertices with more than one child in the arborescence. Each non-leaf vertex has an out-neighborhood consisting of all its children. These out-neighborhoods form a partition of \\( V \\setminus \\{r\\} \\).\n\n3. **Colorful Frames and Number of Leaves**: The colorful frames around the out-neighborhoods of the non-leaf vertices indicate the number of leaves that are connected to each non-leaf vertex through its out-neighborhood. The number of leaves connected to a non-leaf vertex is equal to the number of children it has in the arborescence.\n\n4. **Summing Up the Numbers Below the Out-Neighborhods**: The number of leaves of the arborescence can be calculated by summing up the numbers written below the out-neighborhoods of the non-leaf vertices. This is because each leaf is counted exactly once in this sum.\n\nTherefore, the number of leaves of the spanning \\( r \\)-arborescence \\( T \\) is given by the sum of the numbers written below the out-neighborhoods of the non-leaf vertices.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The number of leaves is the sum of the numbers written below the out-neighborhoods of the non-leaf vertices.}}\n\\]",
