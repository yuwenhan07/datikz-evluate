All the models are trained with pretraining on Objects365. The NMS post-processing times are included for other models and measured on the COCO \\texttt{val2017} with the setting from the official implementation~\\cite{lyu2022rtmdet,yolov8_ultralytics,supergradients}, and the well-tuned NMS postprocessing setting (labeled as ``*'').",
  "response": "It seems like you're comparing the performance of your approach against state-of-the-art (SoTA) real-time object detection models. Here's a structured breakdown of the information provided:\n\n1. **Performance Comparison**: Your approach is claimed to outperform previous SoTA real-time detectors.\n2. **Metrics**:\n   - The x-axis represents the inference time.\n   - The y-axis represents the mean Average Precision (mAP) score on the COCO `val2017` dataset.\n3. **Training Details**: All models were trained using pretraining on Objects365.\n4. **Post-Processing Times**: \n   - For other models, the NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) post-processing times are included.\n   - These times are measured on the COCO `val2017` dataset using the settings from the official implementations of the respective models (`lyu2022rtmdet`, `yolov8_ultralytics`, and `supergradients`).\n   - A well-tuned NMS post-processing setting is also included and labeled as ``*``.\n\nThis setup allows for a fair comparison of the models' performance in terms of both speed (inference time) and accuracy (mAP score).
