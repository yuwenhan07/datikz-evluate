  "response": "To provide a high-level scheme for sequential readout of word size \\( b = 2 \\), we need to understand the context and the existing scheme mentioned in \\cref{fig: unconditional_optimal_layout}. However, since the specific details of \\cref{fig: unconditional_optimal_layout} are not provided, I will create a general framework that can be extended based on typical sequential readout schemes.\n\n### General Sequential Readout Scheme for Word Size \\( b = 2 \\)\n\nIn a sequential readout scheme for a word size of \\( b = 2 \\) bits, each word is composed of two bits. The readout process typically involves reading these bits sequentially from a memory or storage device. Hereâ€™s a high-level description of such a scheme:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Set up the readout circuitry.\n   - Initialize the readout buffer to store the read bits.\n\n2. **Readout Process**:\n   - For each word (which consists of 2 bits):\n     - Read the first bit of the word.\n     - Store the first bit in the readout buffer.\n     - Read the second bit of the word.\n     - Store the second bit in the readout buffer.\n   - Repeat this process until all words have been read out.\n\n3. **Buffer Management**:\n   - Ensure that the readout buffer has enough space to store the bits of one word before moving on to the next word.\n   - After storing both bits of a word, clear the buffer for the next word if necessary.\n\n4. **End Condition**:\n   - Continue the readout process until all words have been read out.\n   - Signal the end of the readout process when no more words remain to be read.\n\n### Example Implementation\n\nHere's a simple example implementation in pseudocode:\n\n```python\ndef sequential_readout(memory, word_size=2, buffer_size=2):\n    # Initialize the readout buffer\n    readout_buffer = [0] * buffer_size\n    \n    # Readout process\n    while True:\n        # Read the first bit of the current word\n        bit1 = memory.read_bit()\n        \n        # Store the first bit in the buffer\n        readout_buffer[0] = bit1\n        \n        # Read the second bit of the current word\n        bit2 = memory.read_bit()\n        \n        # Store the second bit in the buffer\n        readout_buffer[1] = bit2\n        \n        # Check if the buffer is full (i.e., it contains two bits)\n        if len(readout_buffer) == word_size:\n            # Process the stored bits (e.g., print them, store them elsewhere)\n            print(\"Word read:\", readout_buffer)\n            \n            # Clear the buffer for the next word\n            readout_buffer = [0] * buffer_size\n            \n            # Check if there are more words to read\n            if memory.has_more_words():\n                continue\n            else:\n                break\n        else:\n            # If the buffer is not full, continue reading the next bit\n            continue\n\n# Example usage\nmemory = MemorySimulation()  # Assume MemorySimulation is a class that simulates memory access\nsequential_readout(memory)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Pseudocode\n\n- **Memory Simulation**: This is a placeholder for the actual memory or storage device that you would use in your application.\n- **word_size**: The size of each word being read out, which is set to 2 in this case.\n- **buffer_size**: The size of the readout buffer, which is also set to 2 in this case.\n- **readout_buffer**: A list that stores the bits of the current word as they are read.\n- **memory.read_bit()**: A function that reads a single bit from the memory.\n- **memory.has_more_words()**: A function that checks if there are more words to read from the memory.\n\nThis pseudocode provides a basic framework for a sequential readout scheme for a word size of 2 bits. You can extend this framework by adding error checking, additional processing steps, or optimizations depending on the specific requirements of your application.",
