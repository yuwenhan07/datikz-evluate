Since \\(K_2\\) is just two vertices connected by an edge, this condition is trivially satisfied because no graph can be a minor of itself.\n   - Therefore, the pair \\((1,1)\\) does not provide any useful information about the structure of the graph \\(G\\).\n\n3. **Forbidden Pair \\((1,2)\\):**\n   - The pair \\((1,2)\\) refers to the forbidden pair where \\(H_1\\) is the complete graph on 2 vertices \\(K_2\\) and \\(H_2\\) is the complete graph on 3 vertices \\(K_3\\).\n   - This means that the graph \\(G\\) cannot have any subgraph that is a minor of either \\(K_2\\) or \\(K_3\\).\n   - Since \\(K_2\\) is just two vertices connected by an edge, it is always a minor of any graph with at least two vertices. Therefore, the condition that \\(G\\) does not contain \\(K_2\\) as a minor is always satisfied.\n   - However, \\(K_3\\) (the complete graph on 3 vertices) is not a minor of any graph with fewer than 3 vertices. So, if \\(G\\) has at least 3 vertices, it must contain \\(K_3\\) as a minor. Thus, the only graphs that satisfy the condition of not containing \\(K_3\\) as a minor are those with fewer than 3 vertices, which are the empty graph and the single vertex graph.\n\n4. **Cycles \\(C_u\\) and \\(C_v\\):**\n   - The cycles \\(C_u\\) and \\(C_v\\) are cycles involving the vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).\n   - If \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are adjacent, then \\(C_u\\) and \\(C_v\\) could be cycles that include the edge \\(uv\\). For example, if \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are part of a larger cycle, then \\(C_u\\) and \\(C_v\\) might be parts of that cycle.\n   - If \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are not adjacent but form a forbidden pair with some other structure, the cycles \\(C_u\\) and \\(C_v\\) would be more complex and would depend on the specific structure of the graph.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe forbidden pair \\((1,1)\\) does not provide any useful information about the structure of the graph \\(G\\).
