In projective coordinates, these points can be represented as homogeneous coordinates.\n   - For example, \\( v_1 = [1:0] \\), \\( v_2 = [0:1] \\), and \\( v_3 = [-1:-1] \\).\n\n2. **Polytope Definition**:\n   - A polytope is a bounded region in Euclidean space that is the convex hull of a finite set of points.\n   - The convex hull of the vertices \\( v_1, v_2, v_3 \\) in \\(\\mathbb{P}^2\\) forms a triangle in the projective plane.\n\n3. **Homogeneous Coordinates**:\n   - To work with these points in a more familiar setting, we can convert them to Cartesian coordinates by choosing a suitable reference point. However, since we are dealing with projective geometry, it's important to note that the choice of coordinates does not affect the intrinsic properties of the polytope.\n\n4. **Convex Hull**:\n   - The convex hull of three non-collinear points in the projective plane is a triangle. This means that the polytope \\( P_1 \\) is a triangle in the projective plane.\n\n5. **Projective Triangle**:\n   - In projective geometry, a triangle is a fundamental object. The triangle formed by the vertices \\( v_1, v_2, v_3 \\) is a projective triangle, which is a closed figure in the projective plane.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe polytope \\( P_1 \\) corresponding to \\(\\mathbb{P}^2\\) with vertices \\( v_1 = (1,0) \\), \\( v_2 = (0,1) \\), and \\( v_3 = (-1,-1) \\) is a projective triangle.
