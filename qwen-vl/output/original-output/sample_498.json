  "response": "To understand \\(\\mathcal{C}_3(P_3)\\), we need to first define what \\(P_3\\) is and then consider its 3-coloring graph.\n\n1. **Definition of \\(P_3\\)**:\n   \\(P_3\\) (or \\(P_3(n)\\)) is a path graph with 3 vertices. It can be visualized as a straight line with three vertices labeled \\(v_1, v_2, v_3\\) such that there is an edge between \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) and another edge between \\(v_2\\) and \\(v_3\\).\n\n2. **3-Coloring of \\(P_3\\)**:\n   A 3-coloring of a graph is an assignment of one of three colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. For \\(P_3\\), we need to find all possible ways to assign three colors (say, red, blue, and green) to the vertices \\(v_1, v_2, v_3\\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\n3. **Counting the 3-colorings**:\n   Let's denote the colors by \\(R\\) (red), \\(B\\) (blue), and \\(G\\) (green). We will count the number of valid colorings:\n   - If \\(v_1\\) is colored \\(R\\), then \\(v_2\\) must be either \\(B\\) or \\(G\\).\n     - If \\(v_2\\) is colored \\(B\\), then \\(v_3\\) must be \\(G\\).\n     - If \\(v_2\\) is colored \\(G\\), then \\(v_3\\) must be \\(B\\).\n   - Similarly, if \\(v_1\\) is colored \\(B\\), then \\(v_2\\) must be either \\(R\\) or \\(G\\).\n     - If \\(v_2\\) is colored \\(R\\), then \\(v_3\\) must be \\(G\\).\n     - If \\(v_2\\) is colored \\(G\\), then \\(v_3\\) must be \\(R\\).\n   - If \\(v_1\\) is colored \\(G\\), then \\(v_2\\) must be either \\(R\\) or \\(B\\).\n     - If \\(v_2\\) is colored \\(R\\), then \\(v_3\\) must be \\(B\\).\n     - If \\(v_2\\) is colored \\(B\\), then \\(v_3\\) must be \\(R\\).\n\n   Therefore, there are exactly 6 valid 3-colorings for \\(P_3\\):\n   1. \\(v_1 = R, v_2 = B, v_3 = G\\)\n   2. \\(v_1 = R, v_2 = G, v_3 = B\\)\n   3. \\(v_1 = B, v_2 = R, v_3 = G\\)\n   4. \\(v_1 = B, v_2 = G, v_3 = R\\)\n   5. \\(v_1 = G, v_2 = R, v_3 = B\\)\n   6. \\(v_1 = G, v_2 = B, v_3 = R\\)\n\n4. **Graph Representation**:\n   The 3-coloring graph \\(\\mathcal{C}_3(P_3)\\) is a graph where each vertex represents a 3-coloring of \\(P_3\\), and edges connect colorings that differ in exactly one vertex's color. In this case, since there are only 6 colorings, \\(\\mathcal{C}_3(P_3)\\) is a complete graph on 6 vertices, denoted as \\(K_6\\).\n\nThus, the 3-coloring graph \\(\\mathcal{C}_3(P_3)\\) is a complete graph with 6 vertices, which is \\(K_6\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{K_6}\n\\]",
