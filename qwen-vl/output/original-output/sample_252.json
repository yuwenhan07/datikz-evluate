  "prompt": "Overview of the structure of the UPINN method as applied to~\\eqref{eq:1}, which shows inputs and outputs of all known and unknown components, as well as losses. The surrogate solution $U$ outputted by the UPINN takes time $t$ as input. Both $F$ (the known component of the differential equation) and $G$ (the unknown component, to be fit by the UPINN) take in time and $\\hat{U}$, the prediction of the neural network, as input. $F$ and $G$, along with $U_t$ (the autodifferentiated derivative of $U_{NN}$ w.r.t. time) and is passed as input to the PINN loss. Then, the PINN loss computes the error between $U_t$ and $F+G$. The MSE loss computes the error between the surrogate solution $\\hat{U}$ and the data.",
