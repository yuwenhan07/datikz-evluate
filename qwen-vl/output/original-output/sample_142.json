  "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an automaton that recognizes the language defined by the property \\(\\varphi = F_{[0,10]}a \\land G_{[0,20]}\\neg b\\) and its negation \\(\\neg\\varphi\\). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Property \\(\\varphi\\)\nThe property \\(\\varphi\\) can be broken down as follows:\n- \\(F_{[0,10]}a\\): This means that the letter 'a' must appear within the first 10 positions.\n- \\(G_{[0,20]}\\neg b\\): This means that the letter 'b' must not appear at any position.\n\nCombining these two conditions, \\(\\varphi\\) states that 'a' appears in the first 10 positions and 'b' does not appear anywhere in the string.\n\n### Step 2: Constructing the Automaton for \\(\\varphi\\)\nWe will use a finite state automaton (FA) with three states: \\(q_0\\), \\(q_1\\), and \\(q_2\\).\n\n1. **State \\(q_0\\)**: Initial state. This state represents the condition where no 'a' has been seen yet.\n   - On input 'a', transition to \\(q_1\\).\n   - On input 'b', stay in \\(q_0\\).\n   - On input other than 'a' or 'b', reject.\n\n2. **State \\(q_1\\)**: This state represents the condition where 'a' has been seen but 'b' has not been seen yet.\n   - On input 'a', stay in \\(q_1\\).\n   - On input 'b', transition to \\(q_2\\).\n   - On input other than 'a' or 'b', reject.\n\n3. **State \\(q_2\\)**: This state represents the condition where both 'a' and 'b' have been seen.\n   - On input 'a', stay in \\(q_2\\).\n   - On input 'b', stay in \\(q_2\\).\n   - On input other than 'a' or 'b', reject.\n\nThe final accepting state is \\(q_2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Automaton for \\(\\neg\\varphi\\)\nThe negation \\(\\neg\\varphi\\) means that either 'a' does not appear in the first 10 positions or 'b' appears somewhere in the string.\n\nWe will use a similar approach with four states: \\(q_0'\\), \\(q_1'\\), \\(q_2'\\), and \\(q_3'\\).\n\n1. **State \\(q_0'\\)**: Initial state.
