  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to understand what \\( C'_{12} \\) represents and the significance of the automorphism group \\( Aut(C'_{12}) = \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\nFirst, let's clarify what \\( C'_{12} \\) is. Typically, \\( C'_{12} \\) refers to the complement of the cycle graph \\( C_{12} \\), which is a 12-cycle graph. The complement of a graph \\( G \\) is a graph with the same vertex set as \\( G \\) but with edges between vertices that were not connected in \\( G \\). So, \\( C'_{12} \\) would be a graph on 12 vertices where two vertices are connected if they were not connected in the original 12-cycle graph.\n\nThe automorphism group of a graph is the set of all permutations of its vertices that preserve the edge structure of the graph. In this case, we are given that \\( Aut(C'_{12}) = \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), which means the automorphism group of \\( C'_{12} \\) is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3. This implies that there are exactly three automorphisms of \\( C'_{12} \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the properties of \\( C'_{12} \\). Since \\( C'_{12} \\) is the complement of a 12-cycle graph, it is a 12-vertex graph where each vertex has degree 6 (since in a 12-cycle, each vertex has degree 2, and in the complement, each vertex will have degree 10). The automorphism group of \\( C'_{12} \\) being isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) suggests that the graph has a high degree of symmetry, but only three specific symmetries.\n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the problem, we can infer that \\( C'_{12} \\) must be a highly symmetric graph with a small number of automorphisms. One such graph that fits these criteria is the complement of the 12-cycle graph, which is known to have an automorphism group isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the graph \\( C'_{12} \\) is the complement of the 12-cycle graph, and the automorphism group of \\( C'_{12} \\) is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C'_{12}}\n\\]",
