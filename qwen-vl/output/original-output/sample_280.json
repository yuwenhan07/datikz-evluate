  "response": "To understand the resolvability conditions in \\( T^3 \\) (the three-dimensional torus) depending on the distance \\( d_T(u, v) \\), we need to consider how points \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) can be resolved by other points in the torus. Specifically, we need to determine the positions of point \\( x \\) such that \\( d_T(x, u) < d_T(x, v) \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Understanding \\( T^3 \\)**:\n   - \\( T^3 \\) is a three-dimensional torus, which can be visualized as a cube with opposite faces identified.\n   - The distance \\( d_T(u, v) \\) between two points \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in \\( T^3 \\) is the shortest path along the edges of the torus.\n\n2. **Resolvability Condition**:\n   - A point \\( x \\) resolves \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) if \\( d_T(x, u) < d_T(x, v) \\).\n   - This means that \\( x \\) must lie closer to \\( u \\) than to \\( v \\).\n\n3. **Possible Positions of \\( x \\)**:\n   - To find all possible positions of \\( x \\) that resolve \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), we need to consider the geometry of the torus.\n   - In \\( T^3 \\), the distance between any two points \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) can vary from 0 to 6 (since the torus is a cube with side length 1 and opposite faces identified).\n\n4. **Visualizing the Torus**:\n   - Imagine a cube where each face is a square of side length 1, and opposite faces are identified.\n   - The distance \\( d_T(u, v) \\) is the minimum number of steps required to move from \\( u \\) to \\( v \\) along the edges of this cube.\n\n5. **Resolving Points**:\n   - For a given \\( d_T(u, v) \\), the set of points \\( x \\) that resolve \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) forms a region in the torus.\n   - This region can be visualized as a \"strip\" or a \"band\" around the line segment connecting \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in the torus.\n\n6. **Red Vertices**:\n   - The red vertices in the figure represent the positions of \\( x \\) that resolve \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n   - These vertices are typically located at the midpoints of the edges of the cube, forming a grid-like pattern.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe resolvability condition in \\( T^3 \\) depends on the distance \\( d_T(u, v) \\). For a given \\( d_T(u, v) \\), the set of points \\( x \\) that resolve \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) forms a region in the torus. The red vertices in the figure depict these positions, showing the possible locations of \\( x \\) that satisfy the resolvability condition.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The red vertices in the figure depict the positions of } x \\text{ that resolve } u \\text{ and } v \\text{ in the torus } T^3.}\n\\]",
