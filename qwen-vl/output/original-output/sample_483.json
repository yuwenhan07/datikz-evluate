  "prompt": "An illustration of the reduction from densest $k$-subgraph to {{\\sc u-rcp}}. On the left there is a simple undirected graph $G$ with a single edge. The $2$-reduced directed graph of $G$ is on the right. Each vertex of $G$ is replaced by $2\\cdot2 = 4$ copies with a bidirectional edge connecting any two copies of the same vertex, and an outgoing edge from each copy to the single edge-vertex $e$.",
  "response": "The illustration you've described is a step in the reduction process from the Densest k-Subgraph problem (DkS) to the Undirected Reachability Problem (u-rcp). Let's break down the components and the transformation:\n\n### Densest k-Subgraph Problem (DkS)\nIn DkS, we are given an undirected graph \\( G \\) and an integer \\( k \\), and the goal is to find a subset of at most \\( k \\) vertices such that the subgraph induced by these vertices has the maximum number of edges.\n\n### Reduction to Undirected Reachability Problem (u-rcp)\nThe Undirected Reachability Problem (u-rcp) asks whether there exists a path between two given vertices in an undirected graph.\n\n### Transformation Process\n\n1. **Graph \\( G \\)**:\n   - Consider an undirected graph \\( G \\) with a single edge.\n   - In this case, \\( G \\) consists of two vertices connected by one edge.\n\n2. **2-reduced Directed Graph**:\n   - The \"2-reduced\" part refers to the transformation where each vertex in \\( G \\) is replaced by \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) copies.\n   - Each original vertex \\( v \\) is replaced by four new vertices: \\( v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3 \\).\n   - Bidirectional edges connect any two copies of the same vertex (\\( v_i \\) and \\( v_j \\) for \\( i \\neq j \\)).\n   - An outgoing edge is added from each copy \\( v_i \\) to a special vertex \\( e \\).\n\n3. **Explanation of the Transformation**:\n   - The purpose of this transformation is to create a directed graph where the reachability between certain vertices can be used to infer the density of edges in the original graph \\( G \\).\n   - Specifically, if there is a dense subgraph in \\( G \\), it will translate into a high degree of reachability in the transformed graph.\n\n### Example:\nLet's consider the original graph \\( G \\):\n\\[ G = (V, E) \\]\nwhere \\( V = \\{v_1, v_2\\} \\) and \\( E = \\{(v_1, v_2)\\} \\).\n\nAfter the transformation:\n- Each vertex \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) is replaced by four copies: \\( v_{10}, v_{11}, v_{12}, v_{13} \\) and \\( v_{20}, v_{21}, v_{22}, v_{23} \\).\n- Bidirectional edges exist among the copies of the same vertex.\n- Outgoing edges from each copy to a special vertex \\( e \\).\n\nThe resulting directed graph will have a structure where the reachability between specific vertices can be used to determine the density of edges in the original graph \\( G \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThis transformation allows us to reduce the Densest k-Subgraph problem to the Undirected Reachability Problem.
