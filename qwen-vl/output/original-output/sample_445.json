  "prompt": "A heuristic construction of $J_{i_0}$ using $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to represent $L_n$. Let $e_1$ and $e_2$ be the closest and second closest nodes in $L_n$ that also have a link in $E_n$. The smaller red dotted circle denotes $U_{n,i_0} := B_{i_0}(b_n)$, while the larger denotes $B_{e_2}(a_n)$. The intersection gives the set $J_{i_0}$.",
