For any ball of radius \\( r < \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\) in graph-distance around any vertex in \\( G_{k,n} \\), it is isomorphic to the respective ball around \\( 0 \\) in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\).\n2.

The vertices within this ball are those that are at most distance \\( r \\) from \\( v \\). We need to show that this ball is isomorphic to the ball of radius \\( r \\) centered at \\( 0 \\) in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\).\n\n- **Graph \\( G_{k,n} \\)**: This is a random graph where each edge exists independently with probability \\( p = \\frac{k}{n} \\).\n- **Graph \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\)**: This is an infinite random graph where each edge also exists independently with probability \\( p = \\frac{k}{\\infty} = \\frac{k}{n} \\) (for large \\( n \\)).\n\nFor small \\( r \\), the structure of the ball in \\( G_{k,n} \\) is very similar to the ball in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\) because the probability of edges is the same. Specifically, if \\( r < \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\), the ball in \\( G_{k,n} \\) will have a structure that is essentially the same as the ball in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\) up to a certain point. The reason is that the number of vertices within distance \\( r \\) from \\( v \\) in \\( G_{k,n} \\) is finite and manageable, and the probability of edges between these vertices is the same as in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\).\n\nThus, the ball of radius \\( r < \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\) in \\( G_{k,n} \\) is isomorphic to the ball of radius \\( r \\) in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\).\n\n#### Part 2: Balls of Radius \\( r \\geq 1 \\)\nNow consider a ball of radius \\( r \\geq 1 \\) in \\( G_{k,n} \\). We need to show that we can choose \\( n \\) large enough such that this ball is isomorphic to the ball of radius \\( r \\) centered at \\( 0 \\) in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\).\n\n- **Choosing \\( n \\geq \\lceil 2r \\rceil \\)**: If \\( n \\geq \\lceil 2r \\rceil \\), then the ball of radius \\( r \\) in \\( G_{k,n} \\) will contain at least \\( 2r + 1 \\) vertices. This ensures that the structure of the ball in \\( G_{k,n} \\) is sufficiently large to be isomorphic to the ball in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\).\n\n- **Isomorphism**: Since \\( n \\geq \\lceil 2r \\rceil \\), the ball of radius \\( r \\) in \\( G_{k,n} \\) will have a structure that is essentially the same as the ball in \\( G_{k,\\infty} \\) up to a certain point.
