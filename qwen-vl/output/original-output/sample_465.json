  "response": "To find an example of a subcubic graph that demonstrates the non-optimality of the \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\)-upper bound for the locating total-dominating (LTD) number in twin-free graphs, we need to construct a graph where the LTD number exceeds \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\).\n\nA locating total-dominating set (LTD-set) is a subset \\(S\\) of vertices such that every vertex in the graph is either in \\(S\\) or adjacent to exactly one vertex in \\(S\\), and the set \\(S\\) can uniquely identify each vertex based on its neighbors in \\(S\\). The LTD number of a graph \\(G\\), denoted by \\(\\gamma_{LTD}(G)\\), is the minimum size of an LTD-set.\n\nConsider the following graph \\(G\\):\n\n1. Start with a cycle \\(C_6\\) (a hexagon).\n2.
