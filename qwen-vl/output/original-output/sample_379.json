Since \\( P_3 \\) does not contain any cycles of length 3, \\( \\mathcal{C}_3(P_3) = \\emptyset \\).\n\n2. **Induced Subgraph Concept:**\n   - An induced subgraph of a graph \\( G \\) is a subgraph whose vertex set is a subset of the vertex set of \\( G \\) and whose edge set consists of all edges of \\( G \\) that have both endpoints in this subset.\n   - Given a set of vertices \\( S \\subseteq V \\) and a set of edges \\( T \\subseteq E \\), the induced subgraph on \\( S \\) is the subgraph with vertex set \\( S \\) and edge set \\( \\{e \\in E : e \\subseteq S\\} \\).\n\n3. **Identify the Induced \\( P_3 \\):**\n   - The problem asks for the induced \\( P_3 \\) in \\( \\mathcal{C}_3(P_3) \\) generated by \\( (\\{v_1, v_3\\}, C) \\).\n   - Since \\( \\mathcal{C}_3(P_3) = \\emptyset \\), there are no 3-cycles in \\( P_3 \\). Therefore, the induced \\( P_3 \\) cannot be formed from any 3-cycle.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Because \\( \\mathcal{C}_3(P_3) \\) is empty, there is no induced \\( P_3 \\) in \\( \\mathcal{C}_3(P_3) \\) that can be generated by any set of vertices and edges.\n\nThus, the induced \\( P_3 \\) in \\( \\mathcal{C}_3(P_3) \\) generated by \\( (\\{v_1, v_3\\}, C) \\) does not exist because there are no 3-cycles in \\( P_3 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No induced } P_3 \\text{ exists}}\n\\]",
