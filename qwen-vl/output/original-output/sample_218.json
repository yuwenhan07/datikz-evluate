When the integer point \\((0,4)\\) is missing from \\(\\mathrm{Newt}(\\Omega)\\), we move the edge corresponding to the exceptional divisor of the minimal resolution \\(\\mathbb{F}_4\\to\\mathbb{P}(1,1,4)\\) normally inwards until it reaches an integer point. The new edge has affine length \\(4\\), which implies that the strict transform of the branch curve intersects the contracted \\(-4\\)-curve \\(C_1\\) with total multiplicity \\(4\\). The affine distance from the missing point to the new edge is \\(1\\), so the curve \\(C_1\\) appears in \\(\\mathrm{tot}_{\\tilde{Y}}(B)\\) with multiplicity \\(1\\).",
