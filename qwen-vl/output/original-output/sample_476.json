  "prompt": "Flux function $f$ considered in \\S~\\ref{Ss:nondifferentiabilityset}. Close to the origin, $f$ is strictly convex, but not uniformly convex. This flux function is $C^{\\infty}(\\R)$, with all derivatives vanishing at the origin, but of course it is not analytic",
  "response": "The description you've provided refers to a specific type of flux function that exhibits interesting properties near the origin. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Strictly Convex Near the Origin**: The flux function \\( f \\) is strictly convex in a neighborhood around the origin. This means that for any two points \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) close to the origin, and for any \\( t \\in [0, 1] \\), the following inequality holds:\n   \\[\n   f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) < tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2).\n   \\]\n   This property ensures that the function has no \"bumps\" or \"dents\" near the origin.\n\n2. **Not Uniformly Convex**: Despite being strictly convex near the origin, the function is not uniformly convex. Uniform convexity would require that there exists a constant \\( c > 0 \\) such that for all \\( x_1, x_2 \\) in some neighborhood of the origin,\n   \\[\n   f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) \\leq tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2) - c t(1-t) \\|x_1 - x_2\\|^2.\n   \\]\n   The lack of uniform convexity implies that the rate of convexity can vary depending on the distance from the origin.\n\n3. **Smoothness**: The flux function \\( f \\) is infinitely differentiable (\\( C^\\infty \\)) everywhere on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\). This means that all its derivatives exist and are continuous, including at the origin.\n\n4. **Vanishing Derivatives at the Origin**: All derivatives of \\( f \\) vanish at the origin. This means that \\( f'(0) = 0 \\), \\( f''(0) = 0 \\), \\( f'''(0) = 0 \\), and so on. In other words, the Taylor series expansion of \\( f \\) around the origin starts with the second-order term.\n\n5. **Non-Analytic**: Although \\( f \\) is smooth and all its derivatives vanish at the origin, it is not analytic. A function is analytic if it can be represented by a convergent power series in a neighborhood of every point in its domain. The fact that \\( f \\) is not analytic suggests that the function cannot be expressed as a convergent power series around the origin, even though it is infinitely differentiable.\n\n### Example of Such a Function\n\nA classic example of a flux function that fits this description is the function \\( f(x) = |x|^{2+\\epsilon} \\) for some small positive \\( \\epsilon \\). Specifically, consider \\( f(x) = |x|^{2+\\epsilon} \\):\n\n- For \\( x \\neq 0 \\), \\( f(x) = x^{2+\\epsilon} \\) is clearly smooth and infinitely differentiable.\n- At \\( x = 0 \\), all derivatives of \\( f \\) up to order \\( 2 \\) are zero: \\( f'(0) = 0 \\), \\( f''(0) = 0 \\), etc.\n- However, \\( f \\) is not analytic because the higher-order terms in the Taylor series do not converge to the function itself. The function \\( f(x) = |x|^{2+\\epsilon} \\) grows too fast for a convergent power series representation around \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nThis example demonstrates a flux function that is smooth, strictly convex near the origin, but not uniformly convex, and not analytic.",
