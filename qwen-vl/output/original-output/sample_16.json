  "prompt": "An example of our lower bound construction in Theorem~\\ref{thm:0/1_valued_1_query_lower_bound} where $m = 18$. Hence, we set $t=4$ and $n=t^2=16$ resulting in the profile $P$ shown above. In every agent's ranking (horizontal bars), the example mentions the top-ranked alternative. Additionally, we marked alternatives $11$ and $12$ in every ranking in order to showcase the symmetry of $P$. Alternatives $17$ and $18$ are shown for two agents of every cohort. Notice that these alternatives appear in the exact same positions of every agent's ranking.",
  "response": "It seems like you're describing an example of a lower bound construction for a theorem related to query complexity in preference elicitation, specifically focusing on a scenario where \\( m = 18 \\). Here’s a structured breakdown of what this might look like:\n\n### Context:\n- **Theorem**: Theorem~\\ref{thm:0/1_valued_1_query_lower_bound}\n- **Parameters**:\n  - \\( m = 18 \\)\n  - \\( t = 4 \\)\n  - \\( n = t^2 = 16 \\)\n\n### Profile Construction:\nGiven \\( t = 4 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\), we need to construct a profile \\( P \\) with 16 agents. Each agent ranks 18 alternatives.\n\n### Key Elements:\n1. **Ranking Structure**:\n   - Each agent's ranking is represented by horizontal bars.\n   - The top-ranked alternative is highlighted in each ranking.\n   - Alternatives 11 and 12 are marked in every ranking to demonstrate symmetry in the profile.\n   - Alternatives 17 and 18 are shown for two agents from each of the four cohorts.\n\n2. **Symmetry**:\n   - The marking of alternatives 11 and 12 ensures that the profile has a certain level of symmetry across all rankings.\n   - This symmetry helps in understanding how the preferences are distributed among the agents.\n\n3. **Position Consistency**:\n   - Alternatives 17 and 18 appear in the exact same positions in every agent's ranking.\n   - This consistency is crucial for the lower bound construction, as it ensures that the preferences are not overly varied or complex.\n\n### Example Representation:\nSince the actual visual representation isn't provided here, let's describe it conceptually:\n\n#### Agent Rankings:\nEach agent's ranking can be visualized as a horizontal bar where:\n- The length of the bar represents the number of alternatives.\n- The position of the top-ranked alternative is marked at the beginning of the bar.\n- Alternatives 11 and 12 are marked at specific positions within the bar.\n- Alternatives 17 and 18 are consistently positioned at the end of the bar for two agents from each cohort.\n\n#### Symmetry:\n- The marking of alternatives 11 and 12 ensures that the profile is symmetric across all rankings.\n- The consistent positioning of alternatives 17 and 18 across all rankings further reinforces the symmetry and uniformity of the profile.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis profile \\( P \\) is designed to demonstrate a specific lower bound in the context of query complexity. The symmetry and consistency in the rankings help in proving that a certain number of queries is necessary to elicit the preferences accurately. The example showcases how such a profile can be constructed and analyzed to establish the lower bound.\n\nIf you have a specific visualization or more detailed description of the profile, please provide it so I can offer a more precise analysis or further explanation.",
