  "response": "To provide a figure for the proof of Proposition \\ref{prop:3-cyc11} in the context of case \\eqref{case:2}, we need to visualize a specific type of quartet network that is relevant to the proposition. The network should include a \\(3_2\\)-cycle (a cycle of three edges where one edge is internal and contracted to length 0), along with other edges and a hybridization parameter.\n\nHere's a textual description of the figure:\n\n---\n\n### Figure for Case \\eqref{case:2}\n\n#### Description:\nThis figure illustrates a \\(3_2\\)-cycle quartet network under the conditions specified in case \\eqref{case:2} of Proposition \\ref{prop:3-cyc11}. The network consists of four nodes connected by five edges, forming a cycle of three edges where one edge is internal and contracted to length 0. The remaining two edges have lengths \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\), and there is an additional edge with length \\(x\\). The hybridization parameter is denoted as \\(\\gamma\\).\n\n#### Key Elements:\n1. **Nodes**: There are four nodes labeled \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n2. **Edges**:\n   - An internal edge between nodes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is contracted to length 0.\n   - An edge between nodes \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) has length \\(h_1\\).\n   - An edge between nodes \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) has length \\(h_2\\).\n   - An edge between nodes \\(D\\) and \\(A\\) has length \\(x\\).\n3. **Hybridization Parameter**: The hybridization parameter \\(\\gamma\\) is associated with the network structure, indicating the degree of hybridization or recombination among the nodes.\n\n#### Visualization:\nThe figure can be represented as follows:\n\n```\nA ---- 0 ---- B\n|        |    |\n|        |    |\n|        |    |\n|        |    |\n|        |    |\nD ---- x ---- C\n```\n\nIn this diagram:\n- The edge between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is shown as a line segment of length 0, indicating it is contracted.\n- The edges between \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), and \\(D\\) and \\(A\\) are shown with lengths \\(h_1\\), \\(h_2\\), and \\(x\\) respectively.\n- The hybridization parameter \\(\\gamma\\) is not directly visualized but is part of the mathematical model used to analyze the network.\n\n---\n\nThis figure should help in understanding the specific configuration of the \\(3_2\\)-cycle quartet network under the given conditions for the proof of Proposition \\ref{prop:3-cyc11} in case \\eqref{case:2}. If you need a more detailed or graphical representation, please let me know!",
