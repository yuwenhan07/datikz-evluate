Each of the joint components has an $n$-dimensional score vector (column of $\\boldsymbol{U}_J$) and a $p$-dimensional loading vector (row of $\\boldsymbol{V}_J^\\top$) associated with it; in this example, $n = 3$ and $p = 4$. Each subward has an $r_J$-dimensional score vector (row of $\\boldsymbol{U}_J$) associated with it, and each feature has a $r_J$-dimensional loading vector (column of $\\boldsymbol{V}_J^\\top$).

  "response": "The problem you've described involves the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix \\( \\boldsymbol{J} \\), which is a common technique used in various fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and signal processing.
