  "response": "To solve the problem of designing an automaton that recognizes strings over \\(\\{0,1\\}^3\\) which represent the binary addition of two numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) modulo 2, we need to understand the structure of the input and the output.\n\nThe input string is a sequence of three columns, each representing a bit of the numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). The output should be the result of the binary addition of these two numbers, also represented as a sequence of three bits.\n\nLet's denote the input string as:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nwhere each row represents the bits of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) respectively, and the third row represents the bits of \\(m + n\\).\n\nThe binary addition of two numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) can be computed using the following rules:\n- If both bits are the same (both 0 or both 1), the sum is that bit.\n- If the bits are different (one 0 and one 1), the sum is 1.\n\nWe can use a finite state machine (FSM) to implement this logic. Here is a step-by-step construction of the FSM:\n\n1. **States**: We need states to represent the different combinations of the bits from \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). There are \\(2^3 = 8\\) possible combinations of three bits, so we have 8 states. Let's label them as \\(Q_0, Q_1, \\ldots, Q_7\\).\n\n2. **Initial State**: The initial state is \\(Q_0\\), which corresponds to the state where both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are 0.\n\n3. **Transition Function**: The transition function will depend on the current state and the input bit. For example, if we are in state \\(Q_0\\) and the input is \\(x_1y_1z_1\\), then the next state will be determined by the value of \\(x_1y_1z_1\\):\n   - If \\(x_1y_1z_1 = 000\\), go to \\(Q_0\\).\n   - If \\(x_1y_1z_1 = 001\\), go to \\(Q_1\\).\n   - If \\(x_1y_1z_1 = 010\\), go to \\(Q_2\\).\n   - If \\(x_1y_1z_1 = 011\\), go to \\(Q_3\\).\n   - If \\(x_1y_1z_1 = 100\\), go to \\(Q_4\\).\n   - If \\(x_1y_1z_1 = 101\\), go to \\(Q_5\\).\n   - If \\(x_1y_1z_1 = 110\\), go to \\(Q_6\\).\n   - If \\(x_1y_1z_1 = 111\\), go to \\(Q_7\\).\n\n4. **Final States**: The final state is the state corresponding to the all-zero input, which is \\(Q_0\\). This is because the all-zero input corresponds to the case where both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are 0, and the sum is 0.\n\nHere is the transition table for the FSM:\n\n| Current State | Input \\(x_1y_1z_1\\) | Next State |\n|---------------|----------------------|------------|\n| \\(Q_0\\)       | 000                  | \\(Q_0\\)    |\n| \\(Q_0\\)       | 001                  | \\(Q_1\\)    |\n| \\(Q_0\\)       | 010                  | \\(Q_2\\)    |\n| \\(Q_0\\)       | 011                  | \\(Q_3\\)    |\n| \\(Q_0\\)       | 100                  | \\(Q_4\\)    |\n| \\(Q_0\\)       | 101                  | \\(Q_5\\)    |\n| \\(Q_0\\)       | 110                  | \\(Q_6\\)    |\n| \\(Q_0\\)       | 111                  | \\(Q_7\\)    |\n\nThe FSM will accept the input if it ends up in state \\(Q_0\\). Therefore, the automaton will recognize the strings that represent the binary addition of two numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) modulo 2.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The automaton accepts the input if it ends up in state } Q_0.}\n\\]",
