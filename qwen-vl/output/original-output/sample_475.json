  "prompt": "The hierarchy of tasks learned. Gray nodes denote the built-in functions of the robot, and white nodes represent the tasks learned from the curriculum. For built-in actions that involve an object (e.g., close), the object has to be within the field of view for the action to be taken. Special actions (i.e., done and quit) are omitted due to space constraints.",
  "response": "It seems like you're referring to a diagram or a flowchart that illustrates the learning process of a robot, where different tasks are represented by nodes. In this context:\n\n- **Gray nodes** represent built-in functions of the robot.\n- **White nodes** represent tasks that have been learned through a curriculum.\n\nThe diagram also specifies that for certain built-in actions involving objects (like \"close\"), the object must be within the robot's field of view for the action to be executed. \n\nAdditionally, it mentions that special actions such as \"done\" and \"quit\" are not included in the diagram due to space constraints.\n\nIf you need further clarification on any part of this description or if you have specific questions about the diagram, feel free to ask!",
