  "response": "To understand the problem, we need to break it down into several components:\n\n1. **Understanding the Set \\(\\partial \\mathcal{K}\\)**: This typically refers to the boundary of a set \\(\\mathcal{K}\\). In this context, \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) is likely a specific subset of the complex plane or a region defined by some geometric or algebraic constraints.\n\n2. **Intersection with \\(\\Delta_{1,0,-1/5}\\)**: The notation \\(\\Delta_{1,0,-1/5}\\) suggests that we are considering a specific triangle in the complex plane. The vertices of this triangle are at \\(1\\), \\(0\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n3. **Imaginary Parts**: We are interested in the imaginary parts of the points on the boundary of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) that lie within the triangle \\(\\Delta_{1,0,-1/5}\\).\n\n4. **Base \\(-4\\)**: This indicates that we are working in a base \\(-4\\) numeral system. In base \\(-4\\), each digit can be one of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), and the place values alternate between positive and negative powers of \\(-4\\).\n\nGiven these components, let's construct an automaton that recognizes the imaginary parts of points in \\(\\partial \\mathcal{K} \\cap \\Delta_{1,0,-1/5}\\) in base \\(-4\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Construction\n\n1. **Define the Set \\(\\Delta_{1,0,-1/5}\\)**:\n   - The vertices of the triangle are \\(1\\), \\(0\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n   - The sides of the triangle are the line segments connecting these points.\n\n2. **Identify Points on the Boundary \\(\\partial \\mathcal{K}\\)**:\n   - We need to determine which points on the boundary of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) lie within the triangle \\(\\Delta_{1,0,-1/5}\\).\n\n3. **Extract Imaginary Parts**:\n   - For each point on the boundary of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) that lies within the triangle, extract its imaginary part.\n\n4. **Convert Imaginary Parts to Base \\(-4\\)**:\n   - Convert the imaginary parts from their decimal representation to their base \\(-4\\) representation.\n   - Each digit in the base \\(-4\\) representation will be one of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\).\n\n### Automaton Design\n\nAn automaton for this task would have the following components:\n\n- **States**: Represent the different states of the automaton as it processes the imaginary part of a point.\n- **Alphabet**: The input alphabet consists of the digits \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\) (the possible digits in base \\(-4\\)).\n- **Transition Function**: Define how the automaton transitions from one state to another based on the current state and the input digit.\n- **Start State**: The initial state where the automaton begins processing.\n- **Accepting States**: The final states where the automaton accepts the input sequence.\n\n### Example Transition Table\n\nLet's assume we have a simple automaton with the following states and transitions:\n\n- **State 0**: Initial state.\n- **State 1**: Represents the first digit of the base \\(-4\\) representation.\n- **State 2**: Represents the second digit of the base \\(-4\\) representation.\n- **State 3**: Represents the third digit of the base \\(-4\\) representation.\n\nThe transition table might look like this:\n\n| Current State | Input Digit | Next State |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|\n| 0             | 0           | 1          |\n| 0             | 1           | 1          |\n| 0             | 2           | 1          |\n| 0             | 3           | 1          |\n| 1             | 0           | 2          |\n| 1             | 1           | 2          |\n| 1             | 2           | 2          |\n| 1             | 3           | 2          |\n| 2             | 0           | 3          |\n| 2             | 1           | 3          |\n| 2             | 2           | 3          |\n| 2             | 3           | 3          |\n\nThis table assumes that the automaton processes the digits sequentially and moves to the next state upon reading each digit.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe automaton described above would recognize the base \\(-4\\) representations of the imaginary parts of points on the boundary of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) that lie within the triangle \\(\\Delta_{1,0,-1/5}\\).
