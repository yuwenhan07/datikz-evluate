  "prompt": "Semilattice of idempotents of $FI_1$. The red dots are idempotents of $\\langle u \\rangle$ where $u = (-a, 3, b) \\in FI_1$.",
  "response": "To understand the semilattice of idempotents of \\( FI_1 \\), we need to first clarify what \\( FI_1 \\) is and then identify its idempotents. Here, \\( FI_1 \\) typically refers to the free inverse monoid on one generator, which is the set of all finite sequences of elements from a set with inverses, including the empty sequence.\n\nThe free inverse monoid \\( FI_1 \\) can be generated by a single element, say \\( u \\). An idempotent in a monoid is an element that, when multiplied by itself, gives itself. In the context of \\( FI_1 \\), this means that if \\( e \\) is an idempotent, then \\( e^2 = e \\).\n\nGiven \\( u = (-a, 3, b) \\), we need to find the idempotents in the submonoid generated by \\( u \\), denoted as \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\). The idempotents in \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\) are the elements that, when squared, give themselves.\n\nLet's denote the idempotents of \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\) by \\( e_1, e_2, \\ldots \\). Since \\( u \\) is an idempotent in \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\), we have \\( u^2 = u \\). We need to determine other possible idempotents in \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\).\n\nOne important property of idempotents in monoids is that they form a semilattice under the operation of multiplication. This means that for any two idempotents \\( e_i \\) and \\( e_j \\), their product \\( e_i e_j \\) is also an idempotent, and the set of idempotents forms a lattice under this operation.\n\nIn the case of \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\), the idempotents are particularly simple because \\( u \\) itself is an idempotent. Therefore, the only idempotent in \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\) is \\( u \\) itself. This is because any other element in \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\) would not satisfy the idempotent condition unless it is a power of \\( u \\), but since \\( u \\) is already an idempotent, no other idempotent exists in \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\).\n\nThus, the semilattice of idempotents of \\( \\langle u \\rangle \\) is simply the set containing the single element \\( u \\).\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\{u\\}}\n\\]",
