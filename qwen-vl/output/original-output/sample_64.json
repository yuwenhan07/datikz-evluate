  "prompt": "The SIRV Compartmental Model for COVID-19 disease dynamics (similar to the one in Abou-Ismail et al \\cite{Abou-Ismail2020}), consisting Susceptible ($S$), Exposed ($E$), Quarantined ($U$), Recovered ($R$), and Vaccinated ($V$) compartments. Three doses of vaccination are assumed, the second and the third being administered 28 and 208 days after the first. The transmission rate is $\\beta$, recovery rate is $\\delta$, the rate of becoming susceptible after disease is $\\gamma$, the vaccination rates are $\\alpha_i$ for $i^{th}$ vaccination, calculated as a proportion of people who took the previous vaccine, and the rate of vaccination immunity wearing off from $i^{th}$ vaccination is $\\phi_i$.",
  "response": "The SIRV compartmental model you described is an extension of the classic SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model to include additional compartments for exposed individuals, quarantined individuals, and vaccinated individuals.
