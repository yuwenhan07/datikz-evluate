Here, $\\{e_i^{t}\\}_{i=1}^3$ indicates the representative embeddings of three semantically nearest neighboring words to $p_1^t$. The same applies to $\\{e_i^{t-1}\\}_{i=1}^3$ and $p_1^{t-1}$.",
  "response": "To illustrate the concept of bipartite matching in the context of computing the similarity between sense cluster centroids \\( p_1^t \\) and \\( p_1^{t-1} \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem\nWe have two sets of vectors:\n- \\( \\{e_i^t\\}_{i=1}^3 \\): The representative embeddings of three semantically nearest neighboring words to \\( p_1^t \\).\n- \\( \\{e_i^{t-1}\\}_{i=1}^3 \\): The representative embeddings of three semantically nearest neighboring words to \\( p_1^{t-1} \\).\n\nWe want to find the best way to match each embedding from the set \\( \\{e_i^t\\} \\) with an embedding from the set \\( \\{e_i^{t-1}\\} \\) such that the overall similarity is maximized.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Bipartite Matching Problem\nThis problem can be formulated as a bipartite matching problem where:\n- One set of nodes represents the embeddings from \\( \\{e_i^t\\} \\).\n- The other set of nodes represents the embeddings from \\( \\{e_i^{t-1}\\} \\).\n- An edge exists between two nodes if there is a meaningful correspondence (similarity) between the corresponding embeddings.\n\n### Step 3: Compute Pairwise Similarities\nFor each pair of embeddings \\( e_i^t \\) and \\( e_j^{t-1} \\), compute their similarity score. This could be done using any similarity measure such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or any other metric suitable for your data.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Bipartite Graph\nCreate a bipartite graph where:\n- Each node in the left set corresponds to an embedding in \\( \\{e_i^t\\} \\).\n- Each node in the right set corresponds to an embedding in \\( \\{e_i^{t-1}\\} \\).\n- An edge between two nodes has a weight equal to the similarity score computed in Step 3.\n\n### Step 5: Apply a Bipartite Matching Algorithm\nUse a bipartite matching algorithm to find the maximum-weight matching in this graph. A common algorithm for this purpose is the Hungarian algorithm or the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, which finds the optimal assignment of nodes from one set to another such that the total weight of the edges is maximized.\n\n### Step 6: Interpret the Result\nThe result of the bipartite matching will give you the optimal assignments of embeddings from \\( \\{e_i^t\\} \\) to embeddings from \\( \\{e_i^{t-1}\\} \\). This means that for each embedding \\( e_i^t \\), you will have found the most similar embedding \\( e_j^{t-1} \\) based on the computed similarities.\n\n### Step 7: Visualize the Matching\nYou can visualize the bipartite matching by drawing arrows from the embeddings in \\( \\{e_i^t\\} \\) to the embeddings in \\( \\{e_i^{t-1}\\} \\) that were matched. This will help you see how the sense clusters \\( p_1^t \\) and \\( p_1^{t-1} \\) are related through their nearest neighbors.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe bipartite matching process helps us find the optimal correspondences between the nearest neighbors of the sense cluster centroids \\( p_1^t \\) and \\( p_1^{t-1} \\). This allows us to understand how the sense clusters have evolved over time and to compute the similarity between them effectively.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Bipartite matching is used to find the optimal correspondences between the nearest neighbors of the sense cluster centroids.}}\n\\]",
