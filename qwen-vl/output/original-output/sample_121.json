  "response": "To compare the performance of different models against the baseline (Pygmalion 6B), we can use metrics such as day 30 retention and engagement. Here's a step-by-step approach to conduct this comparison:\n\n### Step 1: Data Collection\n- **Baseline Model**: Pygmalion 6B\n- **Test Models**: Assume you have multiple models to test, let's call them Model A, Model B, Model C, etc.\n- **Users**: Assign each model to 5,000 unique new users.\n\n### Step 2: Model Deployment\n- Deploy each model on the platform and assign it to its respective group of 5,000 users.\n- Ensure that all users within a group are exposed only to one model.\n\n### Step 3: Metrics Collection\n- **Retention**: Measure the percentage of users who remain active after 30 days.\n- **Engagement**: Measure the average interaction per user over the 30-day period.\n\n### Step 4: Data Analysis\n- Calculate the improvement in retention and engagement for each model compared to the baseline (Pygmalion 6B).\n- For example:\n  - If the baseline retention rate is 70%, and Model A has a retention rate of 80%, then the improvement in retention for Model A is \\( \\frac{80\\% - 70\\%}{70\\%} \\times 100 = 14.29\\% \\).\n\n### Step 5: Graphing the Results\n- Create a graph to visualize the day 30 retention and engagement improvements.\n- Use a bar chart or line graph where:\n  - The x-axis represents the models (e.g., Pygmalion 6B, Model A, Model B, etc.).\n  - The y-axis represents the improvement percentage (retention and engagement).\n\n### Example Graph\nHereâ€™s an example of how the graph might look:\n\n```\n| Model | Retention Improvement (%) | Engagement Improvement (%) |\n|-------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Pygmalion 6B | 0                         | 0                          |\n| Model A     | +14.29                    | +10                        |\n| Model B     | +12.5                     | +8                         |\n| Model C     | +10                       | +5                         |\n```\n\n### Step 6: Interpretation\n- Analyze the results to determine which models outperform the baseline.\n- Consider factors like computational cost, model complexity, and deployment ease when interpreting the results.\n\n### Step 7: Reporting\n- Summarize the findings in a report.\n- Include the graphs and detailed analysis of the improvements observed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively compare the performance of different models against the baseline and identify which ones offer better retention and engagement outcomes.",
