The axial anomaly is a fundamental concept in quantum field theory, particularly in the context of gauge theories like QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics). It arises from the non-conservation of certain currents due to the breaking of chiral symmetry at low energies. Let's break down the key points related to the axial anomaly and the triangle diagram you mentioned:

### Axial Anomaly
The axial anomaly is a term that appears in the effective Lagrangian of a gauge theory when the axial vector current \( j_A^\mu \) is not conserved. This non-conservation is described by the axial anomaly equation:
\[
\partial_\mu j_A^\mu = -i g^2 \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} F^{\nu\rho} F^{\sigma\mu}
\]
where \( F^{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor of the gauge field, and \( g \) is the coupling constant.

### Singlet Flavour Current
In the context of QCD, the singlet flavour current \( j_0^\mu \) is a combination of the axial vector current and the vector current. It is given by:
\[
j_0^\mu = j_A^\mu + j_V^\mu
\]
where \( j_V^\mu \) is the vector current. The axial anomaly affects the conservation of this singlet current.

### Dark Gluons
The term "dark gluons" refers to hypothetical gluons that do not couple to the standard model particles but only to each other or to new physics beyond the Standard Model. These dark gluons can contribute to the axial anomaly if they are present in the theory.

### Triangle Diagram
The triangle diagram you mentioned is a Feynman diagram that contributes to the axial anomaly. In this diagram, three external lines form a triangle, with one line being an axial vector current and the other two being gauge boson lines (e.g., gluons).

### Contribution to the Axial Anomaly
The triangle diagram contributes to the axial anomaly because it represents a process where the axial vector current is transformed into a vector current through the exchange of gauge bosons. This transformation breaks the axial symmetry and leads to the non-conservation of the singlet flavour current \( j_0^\mu \).

### Summary
The axial anomaly is a consequence of the breaking of chiral symmetry in gauge theories. It is characterized by the non-conservation of the singlet flavour current \( j_0^\mu \), which is sourced by the dark gluons in some theories. The triangle diagram is a specific Feynman diagram that contributes to this non-conservation by representing the transformation of the axial vector current into a vector current through the exchange of gauge bosons.

This process is crucial for understanding the dynamics of quarks and gluons in the presence of chiral symmetry breaking, and it has important implications for the structure of hadrons and the behavior of matter at low energies.
