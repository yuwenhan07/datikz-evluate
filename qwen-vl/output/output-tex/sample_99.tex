It seems like you're referring to a specific diagram or figure (labeled as \Cref{fg3}) that has been transformed using the Yang-Baxter equation. The Yang-Baxter equation is a fundamental equation in the theory of integrable systems and quantum groups, which often involves moving certain elements around in a diagram to satisfy the equation.

Given the context, it looks like the diagram has been manipulated to place a "cross" symbol to the right of the region labeled \(\mathbb{Z}_{< 0} \times \llbracket 1, M + N \rrbracket\). This manipulation is likely part of a process to simplify or solve the system described by the vertex model.

Without seeing the actual figure, I can't provide a detailed description of the transformation. However, if you describe the original figure or provide more details about what the symbols represent, I can help you understand the steps involved in applying the Yang-Baxter equation to achieve this transformation.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on how the transformation was done, feel free to ask!
