It seems like you're referring to a comparison between two curves, likely representing some statistical or computational results, where the blue curve represents one set of data or model predictions, and the green curve represents another. The statement suggests that the blue curve is consistently above the green curve across all tuples from \(\mathcal{S}(5, 60)\), indicating that the blue curve's values are higher than those of the green curve for every tuple in the set.

To provide more context, let's break down the elements:

1. **\(\mathcal{S}(5, 60)\)**: This notation typically refers to a set of tuples where each tuple has 5 components (since \(5\) is mentioned). The second part, \(60\), could be an index or a specific value within the set, but without further context, it's hard to determine its exact meaning.

2. **\(\hat{\tau}\)**: This symbol often denotes a parameter estimate, such as a mean, median, or a specific statistic derived from a dataset. In this context, it appears to be a measure being calculated for each tuple in the set.

3. **Blue and Green Lines**: These lines represent different models, methods, or datasets being compared. The fact that the blue line is consistently above the green line suggests that the blue model or method performs better or provides higher values for \(\hat{\tau}\) across all tuples in the set.

4. **Continuous Lines**: The mention of making the lines continuous implies that there was previously some form of discontinuity or dashed nature to the lines, which has been resolved to make the comparison clearer.

In summary, the statement indicates that the blue curve, which might represent a specific model or method, consistently outperforms the green curve across all tuples in the set \(\mathcal{S}(5, 60)\). This could be important in fields such as statistics, machine learning, or experimental design where comparing different models or methods is crucial. If you need further analysis or interpretation, please provide more details about the context or the specific application.
