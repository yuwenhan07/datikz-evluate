To address your statement, let's first clarify what Lemmas \ref{Lem_Aux4} and \ref{Lem_AuxL2} are referring to in the context of the problem. Since you haven't provided the specific details of these lemmas, I'll assume that we are discussing a common scenario where two lemmas describe similar constructions but with slight differences.

Let's assume Lemma \ref{Lem_Aux4} and Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2} both deal with constructing a function or mapping \(\beta\) based on another function or mapping \(\alpha\). The key difference is in how \(\beta(\alpha)\) is defined in each lemma.

### Lemma \ref{Lem_Aux4}
In Lemma \ref{Lem_Aux4}, the construction of \(\beta(\alpha)\) might involve some additional steps or conditions that are not present in Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2}. For example, it could involve a different set of parameters, a different domain or codomain, or a different method of computation.

### Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2}
In Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2}, the construction of \(\beta(\alpha)\) might be simpler or follow a more straightforward path. It could involve fewer steps, use a different approach, or have a more direct relationship between \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).

### Example
Let's consider a simple example to illustrate this:

#### Lemma \ref{Lem_Aux4}
Suppose \(\alpha: A \to B\) is a function from set \(A\) to set \(B\). In Lemma \ref{Lem_Aux4}, \(\beta(\alpha)\) might be defined as:
\[
\beta(\alpha)(x) = \alpha(x) + 1
\]
for all \(x \in A\).

#### Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2}
In Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2}, \(\beta(\alpha)\) might be defined as:
\[
\beta(\alpha)(x) = \alpha(x) - 1
\]
for all \(x \in A\).

Here, the only difference is the operation performed on \(\alpha(x)\), which is addition in Lemma \ref{Lem_Aux4} and subtraction in Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2}.

### Conclusion
The statement "In Lemma \ref{Lem_Aux4}, the construction of \(\beta(\alpha)\) changes slightly compared to Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2}" is correct if there is a noticeable difference in the definition or computation of \(\beta(\alpha)\) between the two lemmas. This difference could be in the form of additional steps, different operations, or different sets involved.

Thus, the final answer is:
\boxed{\text{The construction of } \beta(\alpha) \text{ changes slightly in Lemma \ref{Lem_Aux4} compared to Lemma \ref{Lem_AuxL2}.}}
