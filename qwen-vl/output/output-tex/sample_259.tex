It seems like you're referring to some mathematical or theoretical context where the notation and definitions are crucial for understanding the problem at hand. However, without the specific equations or definitions provided in \eqref{notationDefs}, it's challenging to give a precise answer.

To help you better, could you please provide more details about what you mean by "the jumps of \(\boldsymbol{M}(z)\)"? Are you referring to the jumps in the function \(\boldsymbol{M}(z)\) across certain points, such as branch cuts in complex analysis, or something else? Additionally, if \(\boldsymbol{L}_{k}\) and \(\boldsymbol{U}_k\) are defined elsewhere, could you provide those definitions as well?

If you can provide more context or the specific equations, I'll be able to offer a more accurate and helpful response.
