To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the graph and how vertices can be reached from each other. The problem statement suggests that each vertex \( j \) for \( 2^k - 1 \le j \le 2^{k+1} - 2 \) can be reached in exactly \( k \) steps. This implies that the graph is structured in such a way that it forms a specific type of tree or network where each level of the tree has a certain number of vertices and the distance between any two vertices at different levels is consistent.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the range of vertices**: The vertices \( j \) are in the range \( 2^k - 1 \le j \le 2^{k+1} - 2 \). This means there are \( 2^{k+1} - (2^k - 1) = 2^k + 1 \) vertices in this range.

2. **Understand the structure**: The problem states that each vertex in this range can be reached in exactly \( k \) steps. This suggests that the graph is a binary tree where each level has a power of 2 vertices, and the distance between any two vertices at different levels is exactly \( k \).

3. **Verify the structure**: In a binary tree, the distance between the root and any leaf node at depth \( k \) is exactly \( k \). The vertices in the range \( 2^k - 1 \le j \le 2^{k+1} - 2 \) correspond to the leaves of the tree at depth \( k \). Therefore, each vertex in this range can indeed be reached in exactly \( k \) steps from the root.

Thus, the structure of the graph must be a binary tree with \( 2^{k+1} \) vertices, where the vertices \( 2^k - 1 \) to \( 2^{k+1} - 2 \) are the leaves at depth \( k \). The distance from the root to any of these leaves is exactly \( k \).

The answer to the problem is that the graph must be a binary tree with the specified properties. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The graph is a binary tree with } 2^{k+1} \text{ vertices.}}
\]
