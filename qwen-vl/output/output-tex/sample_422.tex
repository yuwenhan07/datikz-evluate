The schematic illustration you've described is a common representation used in numerical simulations, particularly those involving domain decomposition methods for solving partial differential equations. Here's a detailed breakdown of the components and the process:

### Components:
1. **Blocks**: These represent subdomains of the overall computational domain.
2. **Halo Cells**: These are special cells around the boundary of each block that store information about neighboring blocks. They are crucial for communication between adjacent blocks.
3. **Face Halo Cells**: These are the cells on the faces of the block that need to be updated with information from the neighboring block.
4. **Edge Halo Cells**: These are the cells along the edges of the block that need to be updated.
5. **Vertex Halo Cells**: These are the cells at the corners of the block that need to be updated.

### Process:
- **Highlighted Cells in Block 1**:
  - **East Side of Block 1**: The blue cells represent the face halo cells, which are the cells on the eastern face of block 1 that need to be updated with information from block 2.
  - **Green Cells**: These represent the edge halo cells, which are the cells along the edges of block 1 that need to be updated.
  - **Red Cells**: These represent the vertex halo cells, which are the cells at the corners of block 1 that need to be updated.

- **Highlighted Cells in Block 2**:
  - The corresponding cells in block 2 that need to be updated are highlighted. These cells are the ones that will provide the necessary information to update the halo cells in block 1.

- **West Permutation**:
  - The term "west permutation" refers to the process where data from block 2 (the right-hand side block) is permuted or transferred to block 1 (the left-hand side block). This is done to ensure that the boundary conditions and continuity of the solution across the interface between the two blocks are maintained.

### Summary:
The schematic illustrates how the halo update process works in a domain decomposition method. By updating the halo cells, the solution in one block can be influenced by the solution in its neighboring block, ensuring a consistent and accurate solution across the entire domain. The west permutation specifically involves transferring data from the right block to the left block, facilitating this inter-block communication.
