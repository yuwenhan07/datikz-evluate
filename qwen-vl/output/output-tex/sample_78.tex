To analyze the statement \(\mathbb{E}_{\mu_{\alpha, \beta_1}} [V(X)] < \mathbb{E}_{\mu_{\alpha, \beta_2}} [V(X)]\), we need to understand what it means and how it can be interpreted in the context of probability and expectation.

1. **Understanding the Notation**:
   - \(\mathbb{E}_{\mu_{\alpha, \beta_1}} [V(X)]\) represents the expected value of the function \(V(X)\) under the probability measure \(\mu_{\alpha, \beta_1}\).
   - \(\mathbb{E}_{\mu_{\alpha, \beta_2}} [V(X)]\) represents the expected value of the function \(V(X)\) under the probability measure \(\mu_{\alpha, \beta_2}\).

2. **Interpreting the Statement**:
   - The statement \(\mathbb{E}_{\mu_{\alpha, \beta_1}} [V(X)] < \mathbb{E}_{\mu_{\alpha, \beta_2}} [V(X)]\) means that the expected value of \(V(X)\) is smaller when measured under the probability measure \(\mu_{\alpha, \beta_1}\) compared to when measured under the probability measure \(\mu_{\alpha, \beta_2}\).

3. **Possible Contexts**:
   - This could be in the context of statistical models where \(\mu_{\alpha, \beta_1}\) and \(\mu_{\alpha, \beta_2}\) represent different parameterizations of the same distribution or different distributions altogether.
   - It could also be in the context of decision theory or optimization problems where different measures represent different scenarios or states of nature.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Without additional information about the specific forms of \(\mu_{\alpha, \beta_1}\) and \(\mu_{\alpha, \beta_2}\), and the function \(V(X)\), we cannot provide a more detailed interpretation. However, the statement itself is clear: the expected value of \(V(X)\) is lower under one measure than under another.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{E}_{\mu_{\alpha, \beta_1}} [V(X)] < \mathbb{E}_{\mu_{\alpha, \beta_2}} [V(X)]}
\]
