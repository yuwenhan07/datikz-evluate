To understand the sequence of morphisms of \(\mathbb{Z}/3\)-covers you described, let's break down the process step by step.

1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a graph \(G\) and consider its \(\mathbb{Z}/3\)-cover. A \(\mathbb{Z}/3\)-cover of a graph is a covering space where each vertex of the cover corresponds to a triple of vertices in the base graph that are connected by edges in the same way as in the base graph. The dilation graph is a graph that represents the possible dilations (or contractions) of the edges in the cover.

2. **First Contracting the Green Edge**: When we contract the green edge in the target graph, we are essentially identifying the two vertices connected by this edge into a single vertex. This operation changes the structure of the graph and its cover. The dilation graph becomes empty because contracting an edge in the cover does not introduce any new dilation flows. The dilation graph remains empty for the first two 3-covers after this contraction.

3. **Second Contracting the Blue Edge**: After the first contraction, we now contract the blue edge in the target graph. Again, this operation identifies the two vertices connected by this edge into a single vertex. The dilation graph again becomes empty because contracting an edge in the cover does not introduce any new dilation flows. The dilation graph remains empty for the third 3-cover after this second contraction.

4. **Dilation Graph in the Third Cover**: In the third cover, the dilation graph is a single vertex. This means that there is only one possible dilation flow, which is the identity dilation (i.e., no dilation at all). This indicates that the structure of the cover has been simplified to a point where there is only one way to contract the edges without introducing new dilation flows.

So, the sequence of morphisms of \(\mathbb{Z}/3\)-covers can be summarized as follows:

- Initially, the dilation graph is empty.
- After contracting the green edge, the dilation graph remains empty.
- After contracting the blue edge, the dilation graph remains empty.
- In the third cover, the dilation graph is a single vertex.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The dilation graph is empty in the first two covers and a single vertex in the third cover.}}
\]
