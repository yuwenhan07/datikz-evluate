To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the graph \( G = K_3 \Box P_3 \) and analyze its properties step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Graph \( G = K_3 \Box P_3 \)
- \( K_3 \) is a complete graph with 3 vertices.
- \( P_3 \) is a path graph with 3 vertices (i.e., a line graph with 3 vertices).

The Cartesian product \( K_3 \Box P_3 \) is formed by taking each vertex in \( K_3 \) and connecting it to all vertices in \( P_3 \). This results in a graph where:
- There are \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) vertices.
- Each vertex in \( K_3 \) is connected to all 3 vertices in \( P_3 \), resulting in 3 edges per vertex in \( K_3 \).

### Step 2: Calculating the Dominating Set \(\gamma(G)\)
A dominating set \(\gamma(G)\) is a subset of vertices such that every vertex not in the subset is adjacent to at least one vertex in the subset. For \( G = K_3 \Box P_3 \):

- The graph \( G \) can be visualized as a 3x3 grid where each row corresponds to a vertex in \( K_3 \) and each column corresponds to a vertex in \( P_3 \).
- Each vertex in \( K_3 \) is connected to all 3 vertices in \( P_3 \).

To dominate the entire graph, we need to ensure that every vertex in \( P_3 \) is adjacent to at least one vertex in the dominating set. Since each vertex in \( K_3 \) is connected to all 3 vertices in \( P_3 \), we can choose any single vertex from \( K_3 \) and it will dominate all 3 vertices in \( P_3 \).

Thus, the minimum number of vertices needed to dominate the graph is 3. Therefore, \(\gamma(G) = 3\).

### Step 3: Calculating the Co-Dominating Set \(\overline{\gamma}(G)\)
A co-dominating set \(\overline{\gamma}(G)\) is a subset of vertices such that every vertex not in the subset is adjacent to at least two vertices in the subset. For \( G = K_3 \Box P_3 \):

- We need to ensure that every vertex in \( P_3 \) is adjacent to at least two vertices in the co-dominating set.
- Since each vertex in \( K_3 \) is connected to all 3 vertices in \( P_3 \), we can choose any single vertex from \( K_3 \) and it will dominate all 3 vertices in \( P_3 \). However, to ensure that every vertex in \( P_3 \) is adjacent to at least two vertices in the co-dominating set, we need to consider the structure more carefully.

By examining the structure, we can see that choosing any single vertex from \( K_3 \) will not satisfy the condition for all vertices in \( P_3 \). Instead, we need to choose at least 3 vertices from \( K_3 \) such that each vertex in \( P_3 \) is adjacent to at least two vertices in the co-dominating set.

Thus, the minimum number of vertices needed to co-dominate the graph is also 3. Therefore, \(\overline{\gamma}(G) = 3\).

### Step 4: Calculating the Zero-Dominating Set \( d_0(G) \)
A zero-dominating set \( d_0(G) \) is a dominating set such that no vertex in the set is adjacent to another vertex in the set. For \( G = K_3 \Box P_3 \):

- We need to find a dominating set where no two vertices in the set are adjacent.
- In \( G \), each vertex in \( K_3 \) is connected to all 3 vertices in \( P_3 \), so no two vertices in \( K_3 \) can be in the same zero-dominating set.

Since there are 3 vertices in \( K_3 \) and each vertex is connected to all 3 vertices in \( P_3 \), the only way to form a zero-dominating set is to choose one vertex from each row in \( K_3 \). This ensures that no two vertices in the set are adjacent.

Thus, the minimum number of vertices needed to form a zero-dominating set is 3. Therefore, \( d_0(G) = 3 \).

### Step 5: Verifying the Given Condition \( d_0(G) > \overline{\gamma}(G) + 1 \)
We have calculated:
- \( d_0(G) = 3 \)
- \( \overline{\gamma}(G) = 3 \)

Now, we check the given condition:
\[ d_0(G) > \overline{\gamma}(G) + 1 \]
\[ 3 > 3 + 1 \]
\[ 3 > 4 \]

This condition is false. However, the problem statement seems to have an error or misinterpretation. Given the calculations, the correct values should be:
\[ \gamma(G) = 3 \]
\[ \overline{\gamma}(G) = 3 \]
\[ d_0(G) = 3 \]

Thus, the correct answer based on the calculations is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
