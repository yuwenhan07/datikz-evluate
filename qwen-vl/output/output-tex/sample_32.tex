To address the statement that the saddle moves of Proposition \ref{prop:newii} are consistent under mirror image, as explained in the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:newimirror}, we need to understand the context and the properties of saddle moves in the context of the propositions mentioned.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Saddle Moves**: In the context of combinatorial game theory or related fields, saddle moves typically refer to moves that are part of a specific strategy or algorithm for solving certain types of games or configurations. These moves often involve transformations or operations on a given structure (like a board or a graph).

2. **Proposition \ref{prop:newii}**: This proposition likely describes a set of rules or a strategy involving saddle moves. The consistency of these moves under mirror image means that if a move is valid according to the rules of Proposition \ref{prop:newii}, then its mirror image should also be valid under the same rules.

3. **Proposition \ref{prop:newimirror}**: This proposition provides the proof that the saddle moves described in Proposition \ref{prop:newii} are indeed consistent under mirror image. The proof likely involves showing that any move that satisfies the conditions of Proposition \ref{prop:newii} will have a corresponding move that also satisfies those conditions when mirrored.

4. **Consistency Under Mirror Image**: For the saddle moves to be consistent under mirror image, it must be shown that the transformation rules or the conditions under which a move is valid remain unchanged when the configuration is mirrored. This could involve checking that the properties or constraints of the saddle moves are preserved in their mirrored form.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that Proposition \ref{prop:newimirror} explicitly states that the saddle moves of Proposition \ref{prop:newii} are consistent under mirror image, we can conclude that the saddle moves described in Proposition \ref{prop:newii} indeed satisfy this property.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The saddle moves of Proposition \ref{prop:newii} are consistent under mirror image, as explained in the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:newimirror}.}}
\]
