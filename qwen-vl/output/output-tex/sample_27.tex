This image appears to be illustrating concepts related to cosmology, specifically focusing on the geometry of spacetime and the concept of cosmological horizons. Let's break down the key elements:

1. **Antipodal Observers**: These are observers located at opposite ends of a spatial dimension (e.g., on opposite sides of a sphere). They follow paths that are symmetric with respect to the center of the sphere.

2. **Cosmological Horizons ($H_{\rm L}$ and $H_{\rm R}$)**: These are the boundaries of the regions visible to each observer. The horizon is the farthest distance that light can reach from the observer within the observable universe. For antipodal observers, these horizons are defined by the points where their respective light cones (the region of space that can be seen by the observer) meet the boundary of the observable universe.

3. **Static Patches ($P_{\rm L}$ and $P_{\rm R}$)**: These are regions of spacetime that are locally flat and have no time-like curvature. They are bounded by the cosmological horizons and represent the regions of spacetime that are accessible to the antipodal observers.

4. **Global Spacelike Slice**: This is a hypothetical surface in spacetime that is spacelike (i.e., it is not part of any light cone) and is used as a reference frame to define the positions of events in spacetime.

5. **Sphere $A$**: This is a point in spacetime, represented by a black dot. It is placed on the global spacelike slice $\Sigma$.

6. **Future Lightsheet**: This is the set of all points that can be reached by light emitted from the sphere $A$. It is shown as a dotted line extending into the future.

7. **Red Segment ($\Sigma_A$)**: This is likely a specific segment of the global spacelike slice $\Sigma$ that intersects the sphere $A$. It could represent a particular slice or cross-section of the spacetime around the sphere $A$.

In summary, this diagram is illustrating the relationship between the positions of two antipodal observers, their respective cosmological horizons, the regions of spacetime they can observe, and the properties of a specific point (sphere $A$) in spacetime. The future lightsheet emanating from $A$ helps to visualize the causal structure of the spacetime around this point.
