To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a \((k,3)\)-decomposition and the structure of a \((k,3)\)-out-forcer. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Decomposition**:
   - A \((k,3)\)-decomposition \((F_k, F_3)\) of a graph \(G\) means that the edges of \(G\) can be partitioned into two sets: one set \(E(F_k)\) which forms a \(k\)-regular graph (each vertex has degree \(k\)), and another set \(E(F_3)\) which forms a 3-regular graph (each vertex has degree 3).
   - The dashed red arcs represent the edges in \(F_3\), and the solid green arcs represent the edges in \(F_k\).

2. **Understanding the Out-Forcer**:
   - A \((k,3)\)-out-forcer is a graph \(G\) such that any subgraph \(H\) of \(G\) with at least \(k+1\) vertices will have an edge that is not in \(H\) but connects a vertex in \(H\) to a vertex outside \(H\). This means that if you remove any \(k\) vertices from \(G\), there will always be at least one vertex left that is connected to a vertex outside the removed set.
   - In the context of the decomposition, the out-forcer property ensures that the graph \(G\) is structured in such a way that removing any \(k\) vertices will leave at least one vertex that is still connected to the rest of the graph through the edges in \(F_k\).

3. **Illustration**:
   - The illustration shows a graph where the edges are divided into two sets: the dashed red arcs form a 3-regular graph \(F_3\), and the solid green arcs form a \(k\)-regular graph \(F_k\).
   - The dashed red arcs are in \(A(F_3)\), meaning they are part of the 3-regular graph \(F_3\).
   - The solid green arcs are in \(A(F_k)\), meaning they are part of the \(k\)-regular graph \(F_k\).

Given the above, the answer to the problem is simply the description of the decomposition and the properties of the out-forcer. The illustration itself provides a visual representation of how the edges are partitioned into the two regular graphs.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The edges of the graph are partitioned into two sets: the dashed red arcs form a 3-regular graph } F_3 \text{ and the solid green arcs form a } k\text{-regular graph } F_k.}
\]
