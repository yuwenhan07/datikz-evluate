The iterated blowup of a \( K_4 \) (complete graph on 4 vertices) is a process where we repeatedly add new vertices and edges to the original graph in a specific way. Let's break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Initial Graph
A \( K_4 \) is a complete graph with 4 vertices, meaning every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. So, \( K_4 \) has 6 edges.

### Step 2: Iterated Blowup Process
The iterated blowup process involves adding new vertices and edges to the original graph. Specifically, for each vertex in the original graph, we replace it with a new vertex and connect this new vertex to all other vertices in the original graph. This process is repeated recursively.

### Step 3: First Iteration
For the first iteration:
- We take the 4 vertices of \( K_4 \).
- For each of these 4 vertices, we add a new vertex.
- Each of these new vertices is connected to all 3 remaining vertices in the original graph.

This results in a new graph with:
- 4 original vertices + 4 new vertices = 8 vertices.
- Each of the 4 original vertices is now connected to the 4 new vertices, so there are \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) edges added.

### Step 4: Second Iteration
For the second iteration:
- We now have 8 vertices from the previous step.
- For each of these 8 vertices, we add a new vertex.
- Each of these new vertices is connected to all 7 remaining vertices in the original graph.

This results in a new graph with:
- 8 original vertices + 8 new vertices = 16 vertices.
- Each of the 8 original vertices is now connected to the 8 new vertices, so there are \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \) edges added.

### Step 5: General Pattern
In general, after \( n \)-th iteration:
- The number of vertices becomes \( 4^n \).
- The number of edges added in the \( n \)-th iteration is \( 4^{n-1} \times 4^n = 4^{2n-1} \).

### Step 6: Thick Edges
The "thick" edges in the context you provided likely refer to the edges that are present in the original \( K_4 \). In the iterated blowup, these edges remain unchanged and are simply part of the structure of the graph at each stage.

### Final Answer
The iterated blowup of a \( K_4 \) results in a graph with \( 4^n \) vertices and \( 4^{2n-1} \) edges added in the \( n \)-th iteration. The thick edges are the original edges of the \( K_4 \), which remain as part of the graph throughout the process.
