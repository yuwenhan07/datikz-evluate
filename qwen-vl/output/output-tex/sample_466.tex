To illustrate the concept described in Lemma~\ref{lem:gdint}, let's consider a two-dimensional domain \(\Omega\) with a point \(z\) inside it, where the boundary Harnack principle fails due to the singularity at \(z\). We aim to estimate the increments of a harmonic function \(u\) between points \(y\) and \(y'\) in a smaller ball centered at \(z\), using the harmonicity in a larger ball.

### Step-by-Step Illustration:

1. **Domain and Points**:
   - Consider a domain \(\Omega\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with a point \(z\) inside it.
   - Let \(B(y, r)\) be a smaller ball centered at \(y\) with radius \(r\).
   - Let \(B(y', r')\) be another smaller ball centered at \(y'\) with radius \(r'\).

2. **Harmonic Function**:
   - Suppose \(u\) is a harmonic function in \(\Omega\), i.e., \(\Delta u = 0\) in \(\Omega\).

3. **Boundary Harnack Principle Failure**:
   - The boundary Harnack principle typically provides estimates on the ratio of harmonic functions across different regions separated by a boundary. However, if there is a singularity at \(z\), this principle may not hold directly.

4. **Regularization Using Larger Ball**:
   - To estimate the increments of \(u\) between \(y\) and \(y'\), we use the harmonicity in a larger ball \(B(z, R)\) that contains both \(B(y, r)\) and \(B(y', r')\).

5. **Harmonicity in Larger Ball**:
   - Since \(u\) is harmonic in \(B(z, R)\), we can use properties of harmonic functions, such as the mean value property or the maximum principle, to control the behavior of \(u\) within this larger ball.

6. **Estimating Increments**:
   - By considering the average value of \(u\) over the smaller balls \(B(y, r)\) and \(B(y', r')\) relative to the larger ball \(B(z, R)\), we can derive bounds on the increments of \(u\) between \(y\) and \(y'\).

7. **Illustration**:
   - Draw the domain \(\Omega\) with the point \(z\) marked.
   - Draw the smaller balls \(B(y, r)\) and \(B(y', r')\) centered at \(y\) and \(y'\) respectively.
   - Draw the larger ball \(B(z, R)\) that contains both smaller balls.
   - Indicate the harmonic function \(u\) by shading or coloring the regions where \(u\) is positive or negative, depending on the context.
