It looks like you're referring to a geometric construction or diagram involving a polygon and some regions. Let's break down the elements of your description:

1. **The Polygon**: The red shape is described as the convex hull (denoted by $\conv$) of the set $\{u, uG, uG^2\}$. This means it is the smallest convex polygon that contains the points $u$, $uG$, and $uG^2$, where $G$ is likely a transformation or scaling factor applied to the point $u$. 

2. **The Regions**: The grey regions represent areas that can be ruled out from $hP^*$ (which might refer to the convex hull of a set $P^*$). These regions are excluded because their apexes (the vertices of these regions) are not within the set $hP^*$.

To provide more specific information or further analysis, we would need:
- A clear definition of what $u$, $G$, and $P^*$ represent.
- The exact coordinates or properties of the points involved.
- The context in which this construction is being used (e.g., in geometry, optimization, or another field).

If you can provide more details, I can help you with a more detailed explanation or solution.
