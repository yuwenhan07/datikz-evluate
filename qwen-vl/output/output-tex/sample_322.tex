To solve the problem, we need to identify the remaining vertices of the six hyperedges in which the Breaker has not yet played in Case 1 of Theorem~\ref{TD(4,4)}. The hyperedges mentioned are:

1. \(\{\alpha_3, \beta_2\}\)
2. \(\{c_2, \alpha_2, \beta_2\}\)
3. \(\{c_2, \alpha_4, \beta_1\}\)
4. \(\{c_3, \alpha_3, \beta_3\}\)
5. \(\{c_4, \alpha_2, \beta_3\}\)
6. \(\{c_4, \alpha_4, \beta_4\}\)

We need to determine the vertices that are not yet connected by the Breaker in these hyperedges. Let's analyze each hyperedge step by step.

1. \(\{\alpha_3, \beta_2\}\): The vertices \(\alpha_3\) and \(\beta_2\) are already connected.
2. \(\{c_2, \alpha_2, \beta_2\}\): The vertices \(c_2\), \(\alpha_2\), and \(\beta_2\) are all distinct and have not been connected by the Breaker.
3. \(\{c_2, \alpha_4, \beta_1\}\): The vertices \(c_2\), \(\alpha_4\), and \(\beta_1\) are all distinct and have not been connected by the Breaker.
4. \(\{c_3, \alpha_3, \beta_3\}\): The vertices \(c_3\), \(\alpha_3\), and \(\beta_3\) are all distinct and have not been connected by the Breaker.
5. \(\{c_4, \alpha_2, \beta_3\}\): The vertices \(c_4\), \(\alpha_2\), and \(\beta_3\) are all distinct and have not been connected by the Breaker.
6. \(\{c_4, \alpha_4, \beta_4\}\): The vertices \(c_4\), \(\alpha_4\), and \(\beta_4\) are all distinct and have not been connected by the Breaker.

Since the vertices in each hyperedge are distinct and have not been connected by the Breaker, the remaining vertices in each hyperedge are exactly the vertices themselves. Therefore, the remaining vertices of the six hyperedges are:

\[
\boxed{\{\alpha_2, \beta_2, c_2, \alpha_4, \beta_1, c_3, \alpha_3, \beta_3, c_4, \alpha_2, \beta_3, c_4, \alpha_4, \beta_4\}}
\]

However, since the vertices in each hyperedge are distinct and have not been connected by the Breaker, the correct answer is simply the union of the vertices in each hyperedge, which is:

\[
\boxed{\{\alpha_2, \beta_2, c_2, \alpha_4, \beta_1, c_3, \alpha_3, \beta_3, c_4, \alpha_2, \beta_3, c_4, \alpha_4, \beta_4\}}
\]
