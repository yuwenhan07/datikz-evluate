It seems like you're referring to a diagram or a flowchart that illustrates the learning process of a robot, where different tasks are represented by nodes. In this context:

- **Gray nodes** represent built-in functions of the robot.
- **White nodes** represent tasks that have been learned through a curriculum.

The diagram also specifies that for certain built-in actions involving objects (like "close"), the object must be within the robot's field of view for the action to be executed. 

Additionally, it mentions that special actions such as "done" and "quit" are not included in the diagram due to space constraints.

If you need further clarification on any part of this description or if you have specific questions about the diagram, feel free to ask!
