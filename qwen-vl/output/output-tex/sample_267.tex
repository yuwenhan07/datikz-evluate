It seems like you've provided some values but didn't ask a specific question or give enough context to provide a detailed answer. However, I can help clarify what these values might represent and how they could be used in a problem.

Given:
- \( p = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( a = \frac{1}{3} \)

These values could represent probabilities or coefficients in various mathematical contexts, such as probability theory, algebra, or geometry. For example:

1. **Probability Context**: If \( p \) represents a probability of an event occurring, then \( p = \frac{1}{2} \) means there's a 50% chance of the event happening.
2. **Algebraic Context**: If \( a \) is a coefficient in an equation, then \( a = \frac{1}{3} \) could mean that this value is used to scale or modify another variable in an equation.

If you have a specific problem involving these values, please provide more details so I can assist you better. For instance, if you're dealing with a geometric problem involving two ladders (blue and green), we would need more information about their lengths, angles, or any other relevant dimensions to solve the problem.
