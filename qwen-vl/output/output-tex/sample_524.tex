It seems like you're referring to a specific mathematical or computational context, possibly related to algorithms or optimization problems where regions \( M^{\rm I}(i) \) represent sets of possible values for a variable \( t \). The notation \( i = \bullet \) and the label \( 0^* \) suggests that this might be part of a more complex system or algorithm.

To provide a clear answer, let's break down the components:

1. **\( M^{\rm I}(i) \)**: This likely represents a region or set of values for a variable \( t \) associated with some index \( i \). The superscript "I" could indicate an initial or iterative step in a process.
2. **\( i = \bullet \)**: Here, \( i \) is being assigned the value represented by the symbol \( \bullet \). In many contexts, \( \bullet \) can denote a wildcard or a placeholder, but without further context, it's hard to determine its exact meaning.
3. **\( 0^* \)**: This notation typically indicates a set of values or a range starting from zero and extending indefinitely (i.e., all non-negative integers).

Given these elements, we can infer that \( M^{\rm I}(i) \) might be a set of possible values for \( t \) when \( i \) takes on a specific value (or set of values if \( i \) is a wildcard). For instance, if \( i = \bullet \), then \( M^{\rm I}(\bullet) \) would be the set of possible values for \( t \) under the condition specified by the rest of the problem.

Without additional details about the specific problem or algorithm, it's challenging to provide a precise definition or example. However, if we assume a common scenario in optimization or algorithm design, \( M^{\rm I}(i) \) might represent a feasible region for \( t \) given certain constraints or conditions defined by \( i \).

If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more accurate and helpful response.
