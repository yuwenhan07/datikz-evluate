To address your statement, let's break down the assumptions and their implications step by step.

### Assumption \ref{cond:irre1}
This assumption rules out the blue dashed path. This means that if the blue dashed path is present in any scenario, it must be excluded from consideration.

### Assumption \ref{cond:irre2}
This assumption rules out both of the red dot-dashed paths. This means that if either of the red dot-dashed paths is present in any scenario, they must also be excluded from consideration.

### Black Solid Paths
All black solid paths are permissible under both Assumptions \ref{cond:irre1} and \ref{cond:irre2}. This means that these paths can be included in any scenario without violating either of the given assumptions.

### Summary
- The blue dashed path is not allowed due to Assumption \ref{cond:irre1}.
- Both red dot-dashed paths are not allowed due to Assumption \ref{cond:irre2}.
- All black solid paths are allowed because they do not violate either Assumption \ref{cond:irre1} or Assumption \ref{cond:irre2}.

Thus, the permissible paths are all the black solid paths, while the blue dashed path and the two red dot-dashed paths are not permissible.
