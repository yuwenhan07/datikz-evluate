The process you're describing pertains to the role of the liver in maintaining glucose homeostasis, which is crucial for overall metabolic balance in the body. The liver plays a pivotal role in this process through its ability to regulate glucose levels via two main pathways: glycolysis during feeding and gluconeogenesis during fasting.

### Glycolysis During Feeding:
- **Glucose Levels**: High.
- **Insulin Levels**: High.
- **Glucagon Levels**: Low.
- **Process**: During feeding, the liver primarily uses glucose as an energy source. It converts glucose into pyruvate through glycolysis, which is then further metabolized to produce ATP (energy) or converted into other molecules like glycogen for storage.
- **Regulation**: Insulin, secreted by the pancreas in response to high blood glucose levels, promotes the uptake of glucose by cells and inhibits the release of glucose from the liver, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.

### Gluconeogenesis During Fasting:
- **Glucose Levels**: Low.
- **Insulin Levels**: Low.
- **Glucagon Levels**: High.
- **Process**: During fasting, the liver switches to gluconeogenesis to maintain stable blood glucose levels. This involves breaking down stored glycogen (glycogenolysis) and converting non-carbohydrate substrates (like amino acids and glycerol from fatty acids) into glucose.
- **Regulation**: Glucagon, secreted by the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels, stimulates the liver to convert these substrates into glucose. Additionally, cortisol and growth hormone also contribute to gluconeogenesis under fasting conditions.

### Summary:
- **Feeding**: High glucose and insulin levels lead to glycolysis in the liver, where glucose is broken down for energy or stored as glycogen.
- **Fasting**: Low glucose and insulin levels, along with high glucagon levels, trigger gluconeogenesis in the liver, where glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources to maintain blood glucose levels.

This coordinated regulation ensures that the body can efficiently manage glucose levels, providing a steady supply of energy while conserving resources during periods of fasting.
