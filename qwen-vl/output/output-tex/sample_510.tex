The problem you've described seems to be referring to a specific type of graph known as a "path graph" or "linear graph," often denoted as \( P_n \) where \( n \) is the number of vertices. In this case, it appears that you're describing a path graph with an even number of vertices, specifically \( P_{2m} \).

In a path graph \( P_{2m} \), the vertices are arranged in a linear sequence such that each vertex (except the endpoints) has exactly two neighbors, and the endpoints have only one neighbor each. This means that the vertices \( v_1 \) through \( v_{2m-2} \) each have two neighbors, while \( v_0 \) and \( v_{2m-1} \) each have only one neighbor.

To summarize:
- The vertices \( v_1 \) through \( v_{2m-2} \) each have a degree of 2.
- The vertices \( v_0 \) and \( v_{2m-1} \) each have a degree of 1.

Thus, the vertices \( v_1 \) through \( v_{2m-2} \) indeed have the maximal degree for this graph, which is 2.

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
