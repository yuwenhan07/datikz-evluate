The statement you've provided seems to be discussing a specific geometric construction in the context of theoretical physics or mathematics, particularly related to orbifolds and singularities. Let's break down the key components:

1. **Orbifold Singularity**: An orbifold singularity is a type of singularity where the local structure is modeled by a quotient space of a Euclidean space by a finite group action. In this case, the singularity is realized by the quotient \(\frac{\mathbb{R} \times [-1,1]}{\mathbb{Z}_2}\), which means we are taking the product of the real line with the interval \([-1,1]\) and then quotienting it by the group \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) (the group of order 2).

2. **Smoothing Out the Orbifold Singularity**: The process of smoothing out an orbifold singularity involves resolving the singularity in such a way that the resulting manifold is smooth. This can often be achieved by performing a blow-up operation, which replaces the singular point with a higher-dimensional space.

3. **Shape on the Right Hand Side of the Picture**: The description suggests that after smoothing out the singularity, the resulting manifold takes on a specific shape. The exact nature of this shape is not specified, but it is implied that it is smooth and does not have any co-dimension 2 defects at the interior point.

4. **Initial Corner and Co-dimension 2 Defects**: The phrase "We pick the initial corner so that no co-dimension 2 defect is present at the interior point" indicates that the choice of the initial corner in the process of smoothing out the singularity is made in such a way that the resulting manifold is free of certain types of defects. Co-dimension 2 defects refer to points or regions in the manifold where the local geometry deviates from the global geometry in a significant way.

In summary, the statement describes a process of resolving an orbifold singularity in a 4-dimensional space, where the initial configuration is chosen to ensure that the resulting manifold is smooth and free of certain types of defects. The exact details of the shape of the manifold after smoothing would depend on the specific mathematical or physical context in which this construction is being applied.
