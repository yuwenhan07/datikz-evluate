To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the graph \( W_5 \) and the concept of a 4-matching. The graph \( W_5 \) is a wheel graph with 5 vertices, where one vertex is connected to all other vertices, and the remaining 4 vertices form a cycle.

A 4-matching in a graph is a set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex, and the total number of edges in the matching is 4. In the context of the problem, we have two adjacent, troublesome slices \( S \) and \( T \) that are somewhat, but not almost disjoint. This means that they share some edges but not all possible edges between them.

The key point here is that our algorithm can choose either the outer edge of \( S \) or the outer edge of \( T \), but not both. This implies that the algorithm must select one of these edges to be part of the 4-matching, and it cannot include both edges from \( S \) and \( T \).

Let's analyze the structure of \( W_5 \):
- The central vertex is connected to all 5 vertices.
- The remaining 4 vertices form a cycle.

If we consider the slices \( S \) and \( T \), they are likely to be formed by selecting certain edges from the graph. For example, if \( S \) is the edge connecting the central vertex to one of the vertices in the cycle, then \( T \) could be the edge connecting the central vertex to another vertex in the cycle, but not necessarily the same as the first edge.

Given that the algorithm can only choose one of these edges, we need to determine which edge to choose. The choice depends on the specific configuration of the 4-matching. However, without loss of generality, we can assume that the algorithm will choose the outer edge of one of the slices to maximize the number of edges in the 4-matching.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is that the algorithm will choose either the outer edge of \( S \) or the outer edge of \( T \), but not both. The specific edge chosen will depend on the exact configuration of the 4-matching, but the key point is that only one of these edges can be included.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The algorithm will choose either the outer edge of } S \text{ or the outer edge of } T, \text{ but not both.}}
\]
