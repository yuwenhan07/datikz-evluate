To understand the given statement about the piece of the complex \(\CFK_{\F[U,V]/UV}(S^3,Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\) that contains the intersection point \(d\) with specific properties, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Context and Definitions**:
   - \(\CFK_{\F[U,V]/UV}(S^3,Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\) is a part of the Khovanov homology complex for the knot \(T_{2,3}\) (the trefoil knot) in the 3-sphere \(S^3\), localized at the quantum parameter \(Q^{0,3}_0\).
   - The complex \(\CFK_{\F[U,V]/UV}(S^3,Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\) is defined over the ring \(\F[U,V]/UV\), where \(\F\) is a field.
   - The intersection point \(d\) in this complex has an Alexander polynomial \(A(d)\) equal to \(\tau(Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\). Here, \(\tau\) denotes the Alexander polynomial of the knot \(T_{2,3}\).

2. **Properties of the Intersection Point \(d\)**:
   - The Alexander polynomial \(\tau(Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\) is a specific polynomial associated with the knot \(T_{2,3}\) under the quantum parameter \(Q^{0,3}_0\).
   - The intersection point \(d\) is part of the complex and its Alexander polynomial is given by \(\tau(Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\).

3. **Generating Element \(d + h\)**:
   - The statement mentions that \(d + h\) generates \(\HFhat(S^3)\). Here, \(\HFhat(S^3)\) refers to the Heegaard Floer homology of the 3-sphere \(S^3\).
   - In the context of Khovanov homology, generating elements often refer to elements that span the entire homology group when combined with other generators or relations.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The piece of the complex \(\CFK_{\F[U,V]/UV}(S^3,Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\) that contains the intersection point \(d\) with the Alexander polynomial \(\tau(Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\) and where \(d + h\) generates \(\HFhat(S^3)\) is a specific subcomplex of the Khovanov homology complex for the trefoil knot \(T_{2,3}\) localized at the quantum parameter \(Q^{0,3}_0\).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The piece of the complex } \CFK_{\F[U,V]/UV}(S^3,Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3})) \text{ that contains the intersection point } d \text{ with } A(d) = \tau(Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3})) \text{ and where } d + h \text{ generates } \HFhat(S^3).}
\]
