To explain the calculations for orienting \( C_v \) using the paths indicated in the picture, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Paths
- **Dotted Red Path (\( d_{to}^{u_1,\text{cw}} \)):**
  - This path represents a clockwise (CW) traversal from point \( u_1 \) to the target point \( t \).
  - It is used to calculate the clockwise distance from \( u_1 \) to \( t \).

- **Dashed Blue Path (\( d_{to}^{u_1,\text{ccw}} \)):**
  - This path represents a counterclockwise (CCW) traversal from point \( u_1 \) to the target point \( t \).
  - It is used to calculate the counterclockwise distance from \( u_1 \) to \( t \).

### Step 2: Calculating the Distances
- **Clockwise Distance (\( d_{to}^{u_1,\text{cw}} \)):**
  - To calculate the clockwise distance, you follow the dotted red path from \( u_1 \) to \( t \).
  - The distance is the length of this path.

- **Counterclockwise Distance (\( d_{to}^{u_1,\text{ccw}} \)):**
  - To calculate the counterclockwise distance, you follow the dashed blue path from \( u_1 \) to \( t \).
  - The distance is the length of this path.

### Step 3: Determining the Orientation
- The orientation of \( C_v \) can be determined by comparing the clockwise and counterclockwise distances.
- If the clockwise distance is greater than the counterclockwise distance, then \( C_v \) is oriented clockwise.
- If the counterclockwise distance is greater than the clockwise distance, then \( C_v \) is oriented counterclockwise.
- If both distances are equal, then \( C_v \) is not oriented (or the orientation is ambiguous).

### Step 4: Example Calculation
Assume we have the following distances:
- \( d_{to}^{u_1,\text{cw}} = 5 \) units
- \( d_{to}^{u_1,\text{ccw}} = 3 \) units

Since \( d_{to}^{u_1,\text{cw}} > d_{to}^{u_1,\text{ccw}} \), the orientation of \( C_v \) is clockwise.

### Final Answer
The orientation of \( C_v \) is determined by comparing the clockwise and counterclockwise distances. If the clockwise distance is greater, \( C_v \) is clockwise; if the counterclockwise distance is greater, \( C_v \) is counterclockwise; if they are equal, the orientation is ambiguous.

\[
\boxed{\text{Orientation of } C_v \text{ is determined by comparing } d_{to}^{u_1,\text{cw}} \text{ and } d_{to}^{u_1,\text{ccw}}.}
