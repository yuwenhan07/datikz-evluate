To solve the problem of determining the winner in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, we need to analyze the given state of the board and check for any winning conditions. A standard Tic-Tac-Toe game is played on a \(3 \times 3\) grid, and the player who gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

Let's assume the state of the board is given as follows (using 'X' for one player and 'O' for the other):

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
X & O & X \\
\hline
O & X & O \\
\hline
X & O & X \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We will check each possible winning condition:

1. **Horizontal rows:**
   - Row 1: \(X, O, X\) (No win)
   - Row 2: \(O, X, O\) (No win)
   - Row 3: \(X, O, X\) (No win)

2. **Vertical columns:**
   - Column 1: \(X, O, X\) (No win)
   - Column 2: \(O, X, O\) (No win)
   - Column 3: \(X, O, X\) (No win)

3. **Diagonal lines:**
   - Main diagonal: \(X, X, X\) (Win for player X)
   - Other diagonal: \(O, X, O\) (No win)

Since there is a win on the main diagonal for player X, the winner of the game is player X.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{X}\).
