Initial States: 
    |---|---|
    | \rho_j^1 | \rho_j^2 |

Step 1: Controlled Unitary Operation
    |---|---|
    | U_C | U_C |

Step 2: Ancilla Qubits Measurement
    |---|---|
    | A1 | A2 |

Step 3: Recombination Based on Outcomes
    If A1 = - and A2 = -
        |---|---|
        | C_{-}(\mathcal{E}(\rho_j)) |
