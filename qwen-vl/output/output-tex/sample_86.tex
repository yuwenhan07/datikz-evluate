It seems like you're referring to some specific notation or context that isn't fully clear from the given text alone. However, I'll try to provide an explanation based on common notations in physics and mathematics.

The terms \( u_i \) and \( u'_i \) often appear in various contexts, such as in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, or optimization problems. The subscripts \( i \) typically denote indices over a set of elements or states.

Given the inequality:
\[
\delta_M + \mathbf{p}_i(1) \geq \delta^{\prime}_M \geq \delta_M,
\]
we can break it down:

- \(\delta_M\) and \(\delta^{\prime}_M\) are likely parameters or thresholds.
- \(\mathbf{p}_i(1)\) could represent a probability or a property associated with state \( i \).

Let's analyze the inequality step by step:

1. **Lower Bound:**
   \[
   \delta_M + \mathbf{p}_i(1) \geq \delta^{\prime}_M
   \]
   This suggests that the sum of \(\delta_M\) and \(\mathbf{p}_i(1)\) is at least as large as \(\delta^{\prime}_M\).

2. **Upper Bound:**
   \[
   \delta^{\prime}_M \geq \delta_M
   \]
   This indicates that \(\delta^{\prime}_M\) is greater than or equal to \(\delta_M\).

Combining these two parts, we get:
\[
\delta_M + \mathbf{p}_i(1) \geq \delta^{\prime}_M \geq \delta_M
\]

This implies that:
\[
\delta_M \leq \delta^{\prime}_M \leq \delta_M + \mathbf{p}_i(1)
\]

### Possible Interpretation:
If this inequality arises in a context where \(\delta_M\) and \(\delta^{\prime}_M\) are thresholds or critical values, and \(\mathbf{p}_i(1)\) represents a probability or a property of a system, then the inequality might be used to determine conditions under which a certain event or state occurs.

For example, if \(\delta_M\) and \(\delta^{\prime}_M\) are energy levels and \(\mathbf{p}_i(1)\) is the probability of a particle being in state \( i \), the inequality could be used to determine when a transition between states is possible or when a system is in a metastable state.

Without more context, it's difficult to provide a more specific interpretation. If you have a particular application or field in mind, please provide more details so I can offer a more precise explanation.
