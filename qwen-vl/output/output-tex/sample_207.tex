    \caption{Plot of Spearman Rank Correlation $\rho$ between the predicted ranks and true ranks of Linear regression (\textbf{Left}) and LightGBM regression (\textbf{Right}) across different training tokens and different number of proxy models. As shown, increasing the number of proxy models significantly boosts $\rho$, while adding more training tokens has diminishing returns.}
