To solve the problem of finding a proper 10-coloring of \((P_6 \square P_7)_\delta\) where the vertices in \(V_2\), \(V_3\), and \(V_4\) are shown in red, blue, and black respectively, we need to understand the structure of the graph and the constraints given.

The graph \((P_6 \square P_7)_\delta\) is a grid-like structure formed by the Cartesian product of two paths, \(P_6\) and \(P_7\). Each vertex in this graph can be represented as an ordered pair \((i, j)\) where \(i\) ranges from 1 to 6 and \(j\) ranges from 1 to 7. The edges connect vertices that differ by exactly one in either the first or the second coordinate.

Given the coloring constraints:
- Vertices in \(V_2\) (red) are connected only to vertices in \(V_1\) and \(V_3\).
- Vertices in \(V_3\) (blue) are connected only to vertices in \(V_2\) and \(V_4\).
- Vertices in \(V_4\) (black) are connected only to vertices in \(V_3\) and \(V_5\).

We need to assign colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Let's start by assigning colors to the vertices in \(V_2\), \(V_3\), and \(V_4\).

### Step-by-Step Coloring:

1. **Coloring \(V_2\):**
   - Since \(V_2\) is connected to \(V_1\) and \(V_3\), we can assign a color to each vertex in \(V_2\) such that it is different from the colors of its neighbors in \(V_1\) and \(V_3\).
   - Let's assign the color red to all vertices in \(V_2\).

2. **Coloring \(V_3\):**
   - Since \(V_3\) is connected to \(V_2\) and \(V_4\), we need to ensure that the color of each vertex in \(V_3\) is different from the colors of its neighbors in \(V_2\) and \(V_4\).
   - Let's assign the color blue to all vertices in \(V_3\).

3. **Coloring \(V_4\):**
   - Since \(V_4\) is connected to \(V_3\) and \(V_5\), we need to ensure that the color of each vertex in \(V_4\) is different from the colors of its neighbors in \(V_3\) and \(V_5\).
   - Let's assign the color black to all vertices in \(V_4\).

Now, we need to extend this coloring to the rest of the graph while ensuring that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We will use the colors white, yellow, green, purple, orange, pink, and brown for the remaining vertices.
