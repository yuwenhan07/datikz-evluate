To analyze the given Stolz type region, we start with the inequality:

\[
|1 - z|^2 < M(1 - |z|^2)
\]

First, let's rewrite the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the inequality in terms of their real and imaginary parts.

Recall that for any complex number \( z = x + iy \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers, we have:
\[
|1 - z|^2 = |1 - (x + iy)|^2 = |(1 - x) - iy|^2 = (1 - x)^2 + y^2
\]
and
\[
1 - |z|^2 = 1 - (x^2 + y^2).
\]

Substituting these into the inequality, we get:
\[
(1 - x)^2 + y^2 < M(1 - (x^2 + y^2)).
\]

Next, we expand and simplify both sides of the inequality:
\[
(1 - x)^2 + y^2 = 1 - 2x + x^2 + y^2,
\]
so the inequality becomes:
\[
1 - 2x + x^2 + y^2 < M(1 - x^2 - y^2).
\]

Rearrange all terms to one side:
\[
1 - 2x + x^2 + y^2 - M + Mx^2 + My^2 < 0.
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
(1 - M) + (-2x + Mx^2) + (y^2 + My^2) < 0.
\]

Factor out common terms:
\[
(1 - M) + x(-2 + Mx) + y^2(1 + M) < 0.
\]

This is a quadratic inequality in \( x \) and \( y \). To understand the region better, we can consider specific cases or use geometric interpretations. However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that this inequality describes an annular region in the complex plane.

The term \( (1 - M) \) determines whether the region is inside or outside the unit disk, and the terms involving \( x \) and \( y \) describe how the region deviates from the unit disk. Specifically, the term \( x(-2 + Mx) \) suggests that the region will be bounded by a curve that is influenced by the parameter \( M \).

For \( M > 1 \), the term \( Mx^2 \) dominates, and the region will be an annulus centered at the origin with an inner radius less than 1 and an outer radius greater than 1. For \( M < 1 \), the term \( -2x \) dominates, and the region will be a more complex shape, but still bounded by a curve that is influenced by the parameter \( M \).

Thus, the region described by the inequality is an annular region in the complex plane, and the exact shape depends on the value of \( M \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\{ z \in \mathbb{D} : |1 - z|^2 < M(1 - |z|^2) \}}
\]
