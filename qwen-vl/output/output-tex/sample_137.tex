To understand the given scenario, let's break it down step by step:

1. **True Parameter**: Let \(\mu^*\) represent the true value of \(\theta_0^*\), which is the unknown parameter we are trying to estimate.

2. **Optimistic Estimate**: \(\bar{\mu}\) is an optimistic estimate of \(\theta_0\). This means that \(\bar{\mu}\) is an upper bound on the true parameter \(\mu^*\).

3. **Estimates by A and B**: Suppose two estimators, A and B, provide their own estimates of \(\theta_0\). Let \(\hat{\mu}_A\) be the estimate provided by estimator A, and \(\hat{\mu}_B\) be the estimate provided by estimator B.

4. **Worst Case Scenario**: The orange lines for \([\hat{\mu}_A', \bar{\mu}_A']\) and \([\hat{\mu}_B', \bar{\mu}_B']\) represent the worst-case scenarios for the difference in estimates due to potential misspecification or model misspecification. These intervals account for the maximum possible deviation from the true parameter \(\mu^*\).

5. **Probability Bound**: It is stated that \(\mu^*\) lies between \([\hat{\mu}, \bar{\mu}]\) with probability \(1 - \delta\). This means that there is a high probability (1 - \(\delta\)) that the true parameter \(\mu^*\) falls within the interval defined by the optimistic estimate \(\bar{\mu}\) and the pessimistic estimate \(\hat{\mu}\).

6. **Difference Between Estimates**: The quantity \(\Delta_{\mu} = \bar{\mu}_B' - \hat{\mu}_A'\) represents the difference between the worst-case optimistic estimate of estimator B (\(\bar{\mu}_B'\)) and the worst-case pessimistic estimate of estimator A (\(\hat{\mu}_A'\)). This difference accounts for the potential misalignment between the two estimators due to misspecification.

In summary, the scenario describes a situation where the true parameter \(\mu^*\) is likely to fall within a certain interval \([\hat{\mu}, \bar{\mu}]\) with high probability, and the worst-case differences in estimates between two estimators A and B are represented by the intervals \([\hat{\mu}_A', \bar{\mu}_A']\) and \([\hat{\mu}_B', \bar{\mu}_B']\). The difference \(\Delta_{\mu}\) quantifies the potential discrepancy between these worst-case estimates.
