It seems like you're referring to a specific context where "DT" likely stands for Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which are used in the study of moduli spaces of stable sheaves on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The "flag moduli space" typically refers to a space parameterizing flags of subspaces in a vector bundle or a sheaf.

Given that you mentioned updating Figure 49, it's possible that the figure was previously illustrating some aspect of how the Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants act on the flag moduli space. If the update has clarified or simplified this concept, it might indeed render the original figure redundant.

However, without seeing the actual content of Figure 49 and its updates, I can't provide a definitive answer. If you have more details about what the figure was showing and how the update affects it, I'd be happy to help further.
