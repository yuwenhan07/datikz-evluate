To solve this problem, we need to understand the definitions and properties of Maximum Edge Cover (MEC) sets for a tree graph \( G \) with a root node \( r \). The conditions given in the theorem \(\text{thm:nes-and-suf-cond-for-tree-graph-to-be-an-MEC}\) provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of edges to be an MEC.

### Definitions and Conditions

1. **Maximum Edge Cover (MEC):** A set of edges \( M \) is a Maximum Edge Cover (MEC) if every edge in the tree \( G \) is incident to at least one edge in \( M \), and no larger such set exists.
   
2. **Skeleton of a MEC:** The skeleton of a MEC \( M \) is the subgraph of \( G \) induced by the vertices that are endpoints of edges in \( M \).

3. **Conditions for a MEC:**
   - Every edge in the MEC must be incident to at least one vertex in the skeleton.
   - If an edge is incident to two vertices in the skeleton, then both vertices must be in the skeleton.
   - If an edge is incident to only one vertex in the skeleton, then that vertex must be a leaf in the skeleton.

4. **Set of MECs with a specific property:**
   - \(\setofMECs{G, r, k}\) denotes the set of all MECs of \( G \) where the root node \( r \) has exactly \( k \) incoming edges in the MEC.

Given:
- \( M_1 \) is an MEC with skeleton \( G \) and \( r \) has exactly 1 incoming edge in \( M_1 \).
- \( M_2 \) is an MEC with skeleton \( G \) and \( r \) has no incoming edges in \( M_2 \).
- \( M_2 \) also belongs to \(\setofMECs{G, r, 0, 1}\).

### Analysis

1. **\( M_1 \) belongs to \(\setofMECs{G, r, 1}\):**
   - By definition, \( M_1 \) is an MEC with skeleton \( G \) and \( r \) has exactly 1 incoming edge in \( M_1 \).

2. **\( M_2 \) belongs to \(\setofMECs{G, r, 0}\):**
   - By definition, \( M_2 \) is an MEC with skeleton \( G \) and \( r \) has no incoming edges in \( M_2 \).

3. **\( M_2 \) belongs to \(\setofMECs{G, r, 0, 1}\):**
   - This means \( M_2 \) is an MEC with skeleton \( G \) and \( r \) has either 0 or 1 incoming edges in \( M_2 \).
   - Since \( M_2 \) already belongs to \(\setofMECs{G, r, 0}\), it must have 0 incoming edges in \( M_2 \).

### Conclusion

The statements provided are consistent with the definitions and conditions given in the theorem. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The statements are correct.}}
