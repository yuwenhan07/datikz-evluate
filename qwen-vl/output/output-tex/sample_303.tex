To address the given problem, let's break it down into two parts:

### Part (a): Labeling of the corners and half-spaces with their outward normals

In this part, we need to label the corners and half-spaces of a polyhedron or a higher-dimensional object with their outward normals.

1. **Half-Spaces**: A half-space is defined by a hyperplane and can be labeled with an outward normal vector. The outward normal vector points away from the half-space.
2. **Corners**: Corners are the points where multiple edges meet. To label a corner with an outward normal, you can consider the outward normal as the sum of the outward normals of the half-spaces that meet at that corner, normalized so that they form a basis for the tangent space at that point.

### Part (b): Pictorial Description of the Face-Corner Correspondence

In this part, we need to describe how the Chern numbers are marked on the faces and corners of a polyhedron or higher-dimensional object.

1. **Chern Numbers on Faces**:
   - For each face \(\mathcal{F}_\lambda\) of the polyhedron, we mark the Chern number \(\text{Ch}_{\mathcal{F}_\lambda, v \times n_{\lambda+1}}\). This Chern number is associated with a class in \(K_i(\mathcal{F})\), which is a K-theory group of the face \(\mathcal{F}_\lambda\).
   - The notation \(v \times n_{\lambda+1}\) likely refers to a specific vector or direction related to the face and the boundary conditions, but without more context, it's best to assume it's a standard way of specifying the Chern number.

2. **Chern Numbers on Corners**:
   - For each corner \(\mathcal{C}_\lambda\), we mark the Chern number \((-1)^q \text{Ch}_{\mathcal{C}_\lambda, v}\). Here, \((-1)^q\) is a sign factor that depends on the dimension of the space and the orientation of the corner, and \(\text{Ch}_{\mathcal{C}_\lambda, v}\) is the Chern number of the image of the class under the boundary map \(\partial^{\mathcal{F} \mathcal{C}}\).
   - The boundary map \(\partial^{\mathcal{F} \mathcal{C}}\) takes a class in the K-theory group of the face \(\mathcal{F}\) and maps it to a class in the K-theory group of the corner \(\mathcal{C}\).

### Pictorial Description

To pictorially describe this, imagine a polyhedron with labeled faces and corners. Each face \(\mathcal{F}_\lambda\) would have a label indicating the Chern number \(\text{Ch}_{\mathcal{F}_\lambda, v \times n_{\lambda+1}}\), and each corner \(\mathcal{C}_\lambda\) would have a label indicating the Chern number \((-1)^q \text{Ch}_{\mathcal{C}_\lambda, v}\).

The outward normals of the half-spaces would be depicted as arrows pointing away from the half-spaces, and the corners would be marked with these outward normals to indicate the orientation.

Here is a simple diagrammatic representation:
