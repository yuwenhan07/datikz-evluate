The Satorian Square is a 5x5 Latin square that has been rotated four times to form the same pattern. The words in the square are arranged such that each row, column, and diagonal reads the same when read from left to right or top to bottom.

Given the problem, we need to arrange the words "ANILINA", "ECUADOR", "CIANURO", and "UANIMUD" in a 7x7 grid such that the words are repeated in a specific pattern. However, since the Satorian Square is a 5x5 grid, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement as it asks for a 7x7 grid which is not possible with the given words.

If we were to consider a 5x5 grid instead, we would need to find a way to fit these words into the grid while maintaining the property that each row, column, and diagonal reads the same when read from left to right or top to bottom. This is a complex task and typically requires a specific arrangement that is known to work for the Satorian Square.

Since the problem asks for a 7x7 grid, it's important to note that this is not possible with the given words because the Satorian Square is specifically designed for a 5x5 grid. If you meant to ask about a 5x5 grid, then we would need to find a specific arrangement of the words that fits the Satorian Square pattern.

For the sake of completeness, let's assume we are dealing with a 5x5 grid and provide an example of how the words could be arranged:

\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
A & N & I & L & I \\
N & I & L & I & N \\
I & L & I & N & A \\
L & I & N & A & N \\
I & N & A & N & I \\
\end{array}
\]

In this 5x5 grid, the word "ANILINA" is repeated in a specific pattern where each row, column, and diagonal reads the same. This is a simplified example and does not include the other words "ECUADOR" and "CIANURO". To include all the words, we would need a more complex arrangement that fits the Satorian Square pattern.

Since the problem asks for a 7x7 grid, it's not possible with the given words. Therefore, the answer to the problem as stated is:

\boxed{\text{Not possible}}
