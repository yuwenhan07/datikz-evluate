It seems like you're discussing concepts from theoretical physics, particularly in the context of quantum field theory or general relativity, where the terms "Cauchy surface," "entangling surface," and "timelike envelope" are used to describe specific regions in spacetime.

Let's break down the key points:

1. **Cauchy Surface**: A Cauchy surface is a spacelike hypersurface that can be used to uniquely determine the state of the system at a given time. In your case, the thick purple line denoted as \(\Sigma_{t=0}\) is a Cauchy surface at \(t=0\). This means that all the information about the state of the system at \(t=0\) can be determined by the data on this surface.

2. **Entangling Surface**: The entangling surface \(\partial \Sigma\) is a boundary that separates two regions (left and right patches in your case). It is typically used in the context of holography, where it represents the boundary of a region in spacetime whose dynamics can be described by a lower-dimensional theory. In your description, it is the boundary between the left and right patches.

3. **Time Band and Timelike Envelope**: The boldface \(\mathbf{B}\) denotes a time band \([\tau_1, \tau_0]\), which is a range of times within which certain events or processes occur. The timelike envelope \(\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{B})\) represents the region of spacetime that is causally connected to the time band \(\mathbf{B}\). This region includes all points that can be reached from any point in the time band \(\mathbf{B}\) by a timelike curve (a curve that moves forward in time).

4. **Entangling Surface for the Wedge**: The entangling surface \(\Sigma_{\mathbf{B}}\) is the boundary of the timelike envelope \(\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{B})\). It represents the boundary of the region of spacetime that is causally connected to the time band \(\mathbf{B}\).

In summary:
- \(\Sigma_{t=0}\) is a Cauchy surface at \(t=0\).
- \(\partial \Sigma\) is the entangling surface between the left and right patches.
- \(\mathbf{B}\) is a time band \([\tau_1, \tau_0]\).
- \(\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{B})\) is the timelike envelope of the time band \(\mathbf{B}\).
- \(\Sigma_{\mathbf{B}}\) is the entangling surface for the wedge \(\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{B})\).

This framework is often used in the study of holographic principles and the AdS/CFT correspondence, where the entangling surface plays a crucial role in relating the dynamics of a higher-dimensional system to a lower-dimensional one.
