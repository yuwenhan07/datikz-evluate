It seems like you're comparing two different types of multi-agent Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with respect to how agents maintain their connections or visibility.

### Left Diagram: Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP

In this type of MDP, the communication structure is dynamic and based on the visibility of agents. Hereâ€™s what it means:

- **Visibility**: An agent can "see" another agent if they are within a certain radius.
- **Reconnection**: When an agent leaves the visibility range of another agent, they do not lose contact permanently. Instead, as soon as the agent re-enters the visibility range of the other agent, they reconnect and resume communication.

This model allows for a more flexible and adaptive communication network where agents can dynamically form and break connections based on their spatial proximity.

### Right Diagram: Cutoff Multi-Agent MDP

In contrast, the Cutoff Multi-Agent MDP has a more rigid communication structure:

- **Visibility**: Similar to the Locally Interdependent MDP, agents have a visibility range.
- **Reconnection**: However, once an agent leaves the visibility range of another agent, they cannot reconnect even if they later re-enter the visibility range. This means that the communication link between these agents is broken permanently.

This model results in a more static and less adaptable communication network, where the loss of visibility leads to permanent disconnection.

### Key Differences

1. **Dynamic vs. Static Connections**:
   - In the Locally Interdependent MDP, connections are dynamic and can be re-established.
   - In the Cutoff MDP, once a connection is lost, it remains lost.

2. **Adaptability**:
   - The Locally Interdependent MDP is more adaptable because it allows for reconnections based on spatial proximity.
   - The Cutoff MDP is less adaptable due to the permanent nature of disconnections.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The Locally Interdependent MDP might be more complex to implement but offers greater flexibility.
   - The Cutoff MDP is simpler but may lead to less efficient communication networks.

### Applications

- **Locally Interdependent MDP**: Useful in scenarios where agents need to dynamically adjust their communication based on their environment, such as in mobile ad hoc networks or dynamic teams.
- **Cutoff MDP**: More suitable for environments where the loss of communication is not recoverable, such as in some distributed systems or certain types of sensor networks.

Understanding these differences can help in choosing the appropriate model depending on the specific requirements of your application.
