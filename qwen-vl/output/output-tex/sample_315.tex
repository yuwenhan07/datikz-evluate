To solve the problem, we need to understand the Thue-Morse shift and the cobounding maps associated with it. The Thue-Morse shift is a one-dimensional subshift of finite type generated by the morphism \(\varphi: \{a, b\}^* \to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) defined by \(\varphi(a) = 1\) and \(\varphi(b) = 0\).

A cobounding map \(X: \{a, b\}^* \to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) is a function that assigns a value in \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) to each word in the alphabet \(\{a, b\}\) such that if two words differ only in their last symbol, then they have different values under \(X\). This means that \(X\) must be constant on cylinders of length 7.

Let's denote the Thue-Morse sequence as \(T = t_0 t_1 t_2 \cdots\), where \(t_n\) is either 0 or 1. The Thue-Morse sequence is defined recursively as follows:
- \(T_0 = 0\)
- \(T_{2n} = T_n\)
- \(T_{2n+1} = 1 - T_n\)

The first few terms of the Thue-Morse sequence are:
\[ T = 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, \ldots \]

We need to find a cobounding map \(X\) that is constant on cylinders of length 7. A cylinder of length 7 is a word of the form \(w_0 w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 w_5 w_6\). Since \(X\) is a cobounding map, it must assign the same value to any two cylinders that differ only in their last symbol. This implies that \(X\) must be periodic with period 7.

Let's consider the possible values of \(X\) on the first 7 symbols of the Thue-Morse sequence:
\[ X(0) = x_0, \quad X(1) = x_1, \quad X(1) = x_1, \quad X(0) = x_0, \quad X(1) = x_1, \quad X(0) = x_0, \quad X(0) = x_0 \]
where \(x_0\) and \(x_1\) are elements of \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\).

Since \(X\) is periodic with period 7, the values of \(X\) on the next 7 symbols will be the same as the first 7 symbols. Therefore, the cobounding map \(X\) can be written as:
\[ X(w_0 w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 w_5 w_6) = 
\begin{cases} 
x_0 & \text{if } w_0 w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 w_5 w_6 \text{ starts with } 0 \\
x_1 & \text{if } w_0 w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 w_5 w_6 \text{ starts with } 1 
\end{cases}
\]
where \(x_0\) and \(x_1\) are elements of \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\).

Thus, the cobounding map \(X\) is constant on cylinders of length 7. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{X(w_0 w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 w_5 w_6) = 
\begin{cases} 
x_0 & \text{if } w_0 w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 w_5 w_6 \text{ starts with } 0 \\
x_1 & \text{if } w_0 w_1 w_2 w_3 w_4 w_5 w_6 \text{ starts with } 1 
\end{cases}}
\]
where \(x_0\) and \(x_1\) are elements of \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\).
