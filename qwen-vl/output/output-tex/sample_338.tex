It looks like you're working with some formal logic or mathematical notation, possibly related to modal logic or a similar field. Let's break down the components of your statement:

1. **Case $\pi=\prevon{i}{\varphi}\cdot\pi'$**: This appears to be a conditional case where $\pi$ is defined as the concatenation of two sequences or expressions: $\prevon{i}{\varphi}$ and $\pi'$. Here:
   - $\prevon{i}{\varphi}$ could represent a sequence or a process that depends on an index $i$ and a function or expression $\varphi$.
   - $\cdot$ denotes concatenation, meaning $\pi$ is formed by combining $\prevon{i}{\varphi}$ and $\pi'$.

2. **$t,e'' \models \phi$**: This is a model-theoretic statement, which means that under the interpretation given by $t$ (a valuation or assignment) and $e''$ (possibly another valuation or environment), the formula $\phi$ is true.

Given these components, it seems you might be dealing with a scenario where the truth value of $\phi$ under certain conditions (determined by $t$ and $e''$) influences the definition or behavior of $\pi$. However, without more context, it's hard to provide a precise interpretation or further analysis.
