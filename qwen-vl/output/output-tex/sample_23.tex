To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the \( k \)-strong semicomplete multipartite digraph \( D' \) with partite sets \( V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_c \). The key points are:

1. Each partite set \( V_i \) has \( k+1 \) vertices except for \( V_c \), which has \( k \) vertices.
2. There are arcs from each vertex in \( V_i \) to every vertex in \( V_{i+1} \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, c-1 \).
3. There are no arcs within the same partite set or between partite sets where there is no arc specified.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the structure step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Vertices in Each Partite Set:**
   - \( |V_1| = k+1 \)
   - \( |V_2| = k+1 \)
   - \( |V_3| = k+1 \)
   - \( \vdots \)
   - \( |V_{c-1}| = k+1 \)
   - \( |V_c| = k \)

2. **Arcs Between Partite Sets:**
   - For \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, c-1 \), there are arcs from every vertex in \( V_i \) to every vertex in \( V_{i+1} \).

### Example Structure

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the structure:
- Suppose \( c = 4 \) (so there are 4 partite sets).
- Then, \( |V_1| = 5 \), \( |V_2| = 5 \), \( |V_3| = 5 \), and \( |V_4| = 4 \).

The arcs would be as follows:
- From every vertex in \( V_1 \) to every vertex in \( V_2 \).
- From every vertex in \( V_2 \) to every vertex in \( V_3 \).
- From every vertex in \( V_3 \) to every vertex in \( V_4 \).

### General Structure

For any \( c \):
- \( |V_1| = k+1 \)
- \( |V_2| = k+1 \)
- \( |V_3| = k+1 \)
- \( \vdots \)
- \( |V_{c-1}| = k+1 \)
- \( |V_c| = k \)

The arcs are from every vertex in \( V_i \) to every vertex in \( V_{i+1} \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, c-1 \).

### Conclusion

The structure of the \( k \)-strong semicomplete multipartite digraph \( D' \) is characterized by having partite sets \( V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_c \) with sizes \( k+1, k+1, \ldots, k+1, k \) respectively, and arcs from every vertex in \( V_i \) to every vertex in \( V_{i+1} \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, c-1 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{D' \text{ is a } k\text{-strong semicomplete multipartite digraph with partite sets } V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_c \text{ where } |V_i| = k+1 \text{ for } i \in [c-1] \text{ and } |V_c| = k, \text{ and arcs from every vertex in } V_i \text{ to every vertex in } V_{i+1} \text{ for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, c-1.}
