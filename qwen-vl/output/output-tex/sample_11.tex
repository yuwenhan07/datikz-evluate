To establish the \( N \)-extendibility of the thermal-noise-channel, we need to understand what it means for a channel to be \( N \)-extendible. A quantum channel is said to be \( N \)-extendible if there exists an extension of the channel to a larger system that can be decomposed into \( N \) independent copies of the original channel.

Given that the initial state \(\rho\) is amplified and split into \( N \) modes using a beam splitter, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Amplification**: The thermal-noise-channel typically involves the addition of thermal noise to the input state. This can be modeled as a quantum channel that adds a certain amount of thermal noise to the input state. For simplicity, let's assume the thermal-noise-channel is a depolarizing channel with a certain probability \( p \).

2. **Beam Splitter**: A beam splitter is a device that splits a quantum state into two modes. In the context of quantum information theory, a beam splitter can be used to create entanglement between the modes. However, in this problem, we are only splitting the state into \( N \) modes without creating entanglement (i.e., the modes are not entangled with each other).

3. **Splitting the State**: If the initial state \(\rho\) is split into \( N \) modes using a beam splitter, then the state after the beam splitter will be a tensor product of \( N \) copies of the state \(\rho\). That is, if the initial state is \(\rho\), then after the beam splitter, the state becomes \(\rho^{\otimes N}\).

4. **\( N \)-Extendibility**: To check if the thermal-noise-channel is \( N \)-extendible, we need to see if there exists an extension of the channel such that the output state after the extension can be decomposed into \( N \) independent copies of the original state. In this case, since the beam splitter simply splits the state into \( N \) modes without any additional interaction or entanglement, the state \(\rho^{\otimes N}\) is already in the form of \( N \) independent copies of the state \(\rho\).

Therefore, the thermal-noise-channel is \( N \)-extendible because the state \(\rho^{\otimes N}\) is already in the form of \( N \) independent copies of the state \(\rho\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{N}
