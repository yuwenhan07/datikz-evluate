It seems like you're describing a method called Forecasting Model Search (FMS) that builds upon DyHPO's multifidelity method. Hereâ€™s a structured summary of the key points:

### Overview of Forecasting Model Search (FMS)

1. **Foundation**: FMS is built on DyHPO's multifidelity method, which is detailed in Algorithm~\ref{alg:dyhpo}.
   
2. **Novel Components**:
   - **Permutation-Invariant Graph Metanetwork (PIGMN)**: FMS uses PIGMN to featureize the model's checkpointed weights (\(\mathbf{W}\)) for input into a deep kernel Gaussian Process (GP). This step is detailed in Section~\ref{pigms}.

3. **Features from DyHPO**:
   - FMS incorporates DyHPO's features related to hyperparameter configuration, budget, and learning curve.
   - These features are described in more detail in \cite{wistuba2023supervising}.

4. **Key Benefits**:
   - **Improved Predictions**: FMS provides better predictions about hyperparameter performance across different compute budgets (refer to Table~\ref{ktau-values}).
   - **Improved Quality of Final Configuration**: The method improves the quality of the final selected configuration across various compute budgets (refer to Figure~\ref{fig:regret_over_time}).
   - **Generalization Potential**: FMS has the potential to generalize beyond the data seen during training (refer to Figure~\ref{fig:fms-transfer}).

5. **Design Choices**:
   - Specific design choices for the surrogate model are detailed in Appendix Section~\ref{meta-hyperparams}.
