To solve this problem, we need to understand the given information and how it relates to the permutations and the algorithm described. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Permutations**:
   - We have two permutations, \(\sigma_0\) and \(\sigma_1\), acting on a set of 12 elements.
   - \(\sigma_0\) is given in cycle notation.
   - \(\sigma_1\) is given as a sequence of arrows, which indicate the mapping of each element under \(\sigma_1\).

2. **Cycle Notation for \(\sigma_0\)**:
   - Cycle notation represents a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. For example, if \(\sigma_0 = (a_1 a_2 \ldots a_k)\), it means that \(a_1\) maps to \(a_2\), \(a_2\) maps to \(a_3\), ..., and \(a_k\) maps back to \(a_1\). All other elements not mentioned in the cycle do not change under \(\sigma_0\).

3. **Arrows for \(\sigma_1\)**:
   - The arrows represent the mapping of each element under \(\sigma_1\). If there is a solid arrow from a boxed founder \(i\) to another element \(j\), it means \(\sigma_1(i) = j\).

4. **Algorithm Reference**:
   - The algorithm referred to is likely a monodromy algorithm, which is used to solve certain types of problems in algebraic geometry or combinatorics. The specific lines mentioned (line \(\texttt{6}\) and line \(\texttt{8}\)) suggest that the algorithm involves some form of iteration or recursion, possibly related to the permutations.

5. **Interpreting the Solid Arrow**:
   - The solid arrow from a boxed founder \(i\) to another element \(j\) indicates that when the algorithm reaches line \(\texttt{6}\), it proceeds to line \(\texttt{8}\) with the input being the element \(j\). This suggests that the algorithm is using the permutation \(\sigma_1\) to map the current state to the next state.

Given the information, the problem is asking us to interpret the solid arrow in the context of the algorithm. Since the solid arrow points from a boxed founder \(i\) to another element \(j\), it implies that the algorithm uses \(\sigma_1\) to map \(i\) to \(j\).

Therefore, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{\sigma_1(i) = j}
\]
