A piecewise constant function \( c(x_1, x_2) \) is defined by assigning different constant values to different regions of its domain. In this case, the domain \(\Omega\) is the square \((-1,1)^2\), which means it's the set of all points \((x_1, x_2)\) where both \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) range from \(-1\) to \(1\).

Let's define such a function with three distinct constant values:

1. \( c(x_1, x_2) = c_1 \) for \((x_1, x_2)\) in the region \( R_1 \).
2. \( c(x_1, x_2) = c_2 \) for \((x_1, x_2)\) in the region \( R_2 \).
3. \( c(x_1, x_2) = c_3 \) for \((x_1, x_2)\) in the region \( R_3 \).

Here, \( c_1, c_2, \) and \( c_3 \) are constants, and \( R_1, R_2, \) and \( R_3 \) are non-overlapping sub-regions of \(\Omega\) that together cover the entire domain.

For example, we could divide the square \((-1,1)^2\) into four equal smaller squares (each with side length 1/2):

- \( R_1 \) would be the top-left quarter: \([-1, -0.5] \times [-0.5, 0]\)
- \( R_2 \) would be the top-right quarter: \([0, 0.5] \times [-0.5, 0]\)
- \( R_3 \) would be the bottom-left quarter: \([-1, -0.5] \times [0, 0.5]\)
- \( R_4 \) would be the bottom-right quarter: \([0, 0.5] \times [0, 0.5]\)

We can then assign different constant values to each of these regions:

\[ c(x_1, x_2) = 
\begin{cases} 
c_1 & \text{if } (x_1, x_2) \in R_1 \\
c_2 & \text{if } (x_1, x_2) \in R_2 \\
c_3 & \text{if } (x_1, x_2) \in R_3 \\
c_4 & \text{if } (x_1, x_2) \in R_4 
\end{cases}
\]

In this specific example, we have divided the domain into four regions, but you can choose any number of regions and any number of constant values as long as the regions are disjoint and cover the entire domain. The function will be constant within each region and will change value at the boundaries between regions.

Thus, the piecewise constant function \( c(x_1, x_2) \) in the domain \(\Omega = (-1,1)^2\) can be written as:

\[ c(x_1, x_2) = 
\begin{cases} 
c_1 & \text{if } (x_1, x_2) \in R_1 \\
c_2 & \text{if } (x_1, x_2) \in R_2 \\
c_3 & \text{if } (x_1, x_2) \in R_3 \\
c_4 & \text{if } (x_1, x_2) \in R_4 
\end{cases}
\]

where \( R_1, R_2, R_3, \) and \( R_4 \) are the four regions of the square \((-1,1)^2\).
