To illustrate Lemma \ref{lem:herali1} in the case where \( E = \mathbb{R}^2 \), we need to visualize the geometric relationships described by the lemma. Let's break down the components step-by-step:

1. **Unit Sphere \(\mathbf{S}\)**:
   - The unit sphere \(\mathbf{S}\) is the set of all points in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) that are at a distance of 1 from the origin. It can be represented as the boundary of the closed disk centered at the origin with radius 1.

2. **Ellipses**:
   - \( h(\mathbf{S}) \): This is an ellipse obtained by applying some transformation \( h \) to the unit sphere \(\mathbf{S}\).
   - \( g(\mathbf{S}) \): This is another ellipse obtained by applying some transformation \( g \) to the unit sphere \(\mathbf{S}\).
   - \( gh(\mathbf{S}) \): This is the ellipse obtained by applying the composition of transformations \( gh \) to the unit sphere \(\mathbf{S}\).

3. **Angles**:
   - \(\varepsilon_2\): This is the angle between the main axis of the ellipse \( h(\mathbf{S}) \) and the dashed line \(\ker(w_1^g)\). The dashed line \(\ker(w_1^g)\) is the kernel of the linear transformation \( w_1^g \), which is a line passing through the origin.
   - \(\varepsilon_3\): This is the angle between the ellipse \( gh(\mathbf{S}) \) and the dashed line \(\ker(w^f_1)\). The dashed line \(\ker(w^f_1)\) is the kernel of the linear transformation \( w^f_1 \), which is also a line passing through the origin.

4. **Illustration**:
   - Draw the unit sphere \(\mathbf{S}\) as a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.
   - Draw the ellipse \( h(\mathbf{S}) \) by stretching or compressing the unit sphere along its axes. The main axis of this ellipse will be the direction of maximum stretch.
   - Draw the ellipse \( g(\mathbf{S}) \) similarly, but it could be stretched or compressed differently compared to \( h(\mathbf{S}) \).
   - Draw the ellipse \( gh(\mathbf{S}) \) by applying the transformation \( gh \) to the unit sphere. This ellipse will be the result of the composition of the transformations \( h \) and \( g \).
   - Draw the dashed lines \(\ker(w_1^g)\) and \(\ker(w^f_1)\) as lines passing through the origin. These lines represent the kernels of the linear transformations \( w_1^g \) and \( w^f_1 \), respectively.
   - Measure the angles \(\varepsilon_2\) and \(\varepsilon_3\) as described above.

The illustration would look something like this (conceptual representation):
