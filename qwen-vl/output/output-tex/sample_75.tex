Certainly! Let's break down how a simplified two-layer transformer architecture processes the sentence "The cat is on the" step-by-step.

### Step 1: Word Embedding
First, each word in the sentence is converted into an embedding vector. For simplicity, let's assume we have pre-trained word embeddings where:
- "The" → \( \mathbf{e}_{\text{the}} \)
- "cat" → \( \mathbf{e}_{\text{cat}} \)
- "is" → \( \mathbf{e}_{\text{is}} \)
- "on" → \( \mathbf{e}_{\text{on}} \)
- "the" → \( \mathbf{e}_{\text{the}} \) (repeated)

### Step 2: First Layer: Self-Attention (Att)
In the first layer, the self-attention mechanism allows each word to attend to every other word in the sequence. This is done through three linear projections:

#### Query (\(Q\)), Key (\(K\)), and Value (\(V\)) Matrices
For each word \(i\) in the sequence, we compute the query, key, and value matrices as follows:
\[ Q_i = W_Q \cdot \mathbf{e}_i \]
\[ K_i = W_K \cdot \mathbf{e}_i \]
\[ V_i = W_V \cdot \mathbf{e}_i \]

Where \(W_Q\), \(W_K\), and \(W_V\) are weight matrices learned during training.

#### Attention Scores
The attention scores \(A_{ij}\) between word \(i\) and word \(j\) are computed using the dot product of the query and key vectors:
\[ A_{ij} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_i^T K_j}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) \]
where \(d_k\) is the dimensionality of the key vector.

#### Weighted Sum
The weighted sum of the values is then computed:
\[ \text{Att}(i) = \sum_j A_{ij} V_j \]

This gives us the new contextualized embedding for word \(i\).

### Step 3: First Layer: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
After obtaining the contextualized embeddings from the self-attention mechanism, the MLP is applied to further process these embeddings. The MLP consists of two fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions:
\[ \text{MLP}(i) = \text{ReLU}(W_1 \cdot \text{Att}(i) + b_1) \]
\[ \text{MLP}(i) = W_2 \cdot \text{ReLU}(W_1 \cdot \text{Att}(i) + b_1) + b_2 \]

Where \(W_1\), \(W_2\) are weight matrices, and \(b_1\), \(b_2\) are bias terms.

### Step 4: Second Layer: Self-Attention (Att)
The second layer applies the same self-attention mechanism as the first layer to the output of the first layer's MLP. This helps to capture long-range dependencies within the sequence.

### Step 5: Second Layer: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
The second layer's MLP is applied to the output of the second layer's self-attention mechanism in the same manner as the first layer's MLP.

### Step 6: Final Layer: Output
The final layer of the transformer is typically a linear layer that projects the output of the last MLP layer into a probability distribution over the vocabulary. For the next token prediction, this would be:
\[ P(\text{next token}) = \text{softmax}(W_o \cdot \text{MLP}(i) + b_o) \]

Where \(W_o\) is the weight matrix and \(b_o\) is the bias term for the final linear layer.

### Summary
In summary, the simplified two-layer transformer architecture processes the sentence "The cat is on the" by:
1. Converting each word into an embedding vector.
2. Applying self-attention in both layers to allow words to attend to each other.
3. Using a multi-layer perceptron in both layers to further process the contextualized embeddings.
4. Producing probabilities for the next token at the final layer.

This process helps the model understand the context and relationships between words in the sentence, enabling it to predict the next word accurately.
