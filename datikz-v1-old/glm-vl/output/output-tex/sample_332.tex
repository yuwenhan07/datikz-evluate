<think>Got it, let's try to figure out how to illustrate the set \( C_p \) for \( p = 1 \) and \( 0 < \theta < \pi/2 \), along with related quantities. First, I need to recall what \( C_p \) typically represents. Often, in complex analysis or geometry, \( C_p \) might refer to a set related to the Chebyshev polynomial or a circular arc, but since the question mentions equations involving tan, linear, and logarithmic functions, maybe it's related to angles or trigonometric relationships.

First, let's parse the problem. The set \( C_p \) is defined in equation (C_p_theta), which probably relates to some angle or parameter. For \( p = 1 \), maybe \( C_1 \) is a specific set, like a sector or a region defined by certain inequalities involving trigonometric functions. The related quantities might include angles, lengths, or other parameters related to the set.

The image description mentions a whiteboard with equations: one is a tan function (probably \( \tan(\theta) \)), another is linear \( y = mx + b \), and another is logarithmic \( y = \ln(x + 1) \). The graphs show these functions, so maybe the set \( C_p \) is defined by the intersection or relationship between these functions.

Let's start by considering \( p = 1 \) and \( 0 < \theta < \pi/2 \). If \( C_p \) is related to a sector or a region in the plane, maybe defined by angles or distances. Suppose \( C_1 \) is the set of points (x, y) such that some condition involving tan(theta), linear, and logarithmic functions. Alternatively, maybe \( C_p \) is defined by an equation like \( \tan(\theta) = p \), but for \( p = 1 \), that would be \( \tan(\theta) = 1 \), so \( \theta = \pi/4 \), but the range is \( 0 < \theta < \pi/2 \), so theta = 45 degrees.

Alternatively, if the set \( C_p \) is defined by an inequality involving the tangent function, like \( \tan(\theta) \leq p \), for \( p = 1 \), that would be \( \tan(\theta) \leq 1 \), so \( \theta \leq \pi/4 \), but since \( 0 < \theta < \pi/2 \), the set would be the region between 0 and pi/4. But the image mentions graphs of tan, linear, and logarithmic functions, so maybe the set is the intersection of regions defined by these functions.

Another angle: logarithmic functions often appear in contexts involving growth rates or inverse functions. The linear function \( y = mx + b \) might be a tangent line to a logarithmic function or intersect with the tan function. For example, if we have \( y = \tan(\theta) \), \( y = mx + b \), and \( y = \ln(x + 1) \), maybe the set \( C_p \) is defined by the intersection points or the region bounded by these curves.

Let's consider specific equations. Suppose equation (C_p_theta) is something like \( \tan(\theta) = p \), then for \( p = 1 \), \( \theta = \pi/4 \). But the set \( C_p \) might be a sector with angle theta, so the set of points in the sector. Alternatively, if \( C_p \) is defined by \( \theta \leq \arctan(p) \), then for \( p = 1 \), it's the region below the line theta = pi/4.

The graphs would show the tan function as a curve increasing from 0 to infinity as theta approaches pi/2, the linear function as a straight line with slope m, maybe intersecting the tan function at some point, and the logarithmic function as a curve starting at (0,0) but defined for x > -1, increasing slowly. The set \( C_p \) might be the region bounded by these curves, like the area between the tan curve, the linear line, and the logarithmic curve, or the intersection of their domains.

Since the problem mentions "related quantities", maybe there are other parameters like the angle theta, the slope m, or the logarithmic term's argument. The illustration would need to show the geometric representation of \( C_p \), perhaps as a sector or a polygonal region defined by the intersection of the curves, with labels indicating the equations and the set's boundaries.

In summary, to illustrate \( C_p \) for \( p = 1 \) and \( 0 < \theta < \pi/2 \), one would draw a coordinate system, plot the tan(theta) function, the linear function, and the logarithmic function, then shade the region corresponding to \( C_p \), which is likely bounded by these curves, and label the equations and the set's characteristics. The key is to show the relationship between the trigonometric, linear, and logarithmic functions and how they define the set \( C_p \).</think><answer>To illustrate the set \( C_p \) for \( p = 1 \) and \( 0 < \theta < \pi/2 \), along with related quantities, follow these steps:  

1. **Define the Equations**:  
   - The tangent function: \( \tan(\theta) \), which increases from 0 to \( +\infty \) as \( \theta \) approaches \( \pi/2 \).  
   - The linear function: \( y = mx + b \), a straight line with slope \( m \) and y-intercept \( b \).  
   - The logarithmic function: \( y = \ln(x + 1) \), defined for \( x > -1 \), increasing slowly from \( -\infty \) to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to +\infty \).  

2. **Graph the Functions**:  
   Plot these functions on a coordinate system. For \( p = 1 \), if \( C_p \) is defined by \( \tan(\theta) = 1 \), then \( \theta = \pi/4 \) (45Â°). The set \( C_p \) likely represents a region bounded by these curves, such as the sector between \( \theta = 0 \) and \( \theta = \pi/4 \), or the intersection of regions defined by the inequalities involving these functions.  

3. **Illustrate the Set \( C_p \)**:  
   Shade the region corresponding to \( C_p \), which may be bounded by the tangent curve at \( \theta = \pi/4 \), the linear function, and the logarithmic function. Label the equations and key points (e.g., intersection points of the curves) to show their relationship.  

4. **Related Quantities**:  
   Include annotations for parameters like \( \theta \), the slope \( m \), or the logarithmic argument \( x + 1 \), explaining how they define the boundaries of \( C_p \).  

The illustration will show the geometric relationship between the trigonometric, linear, and logarithmic functions, with \( C_p \) as the shaded region bounded by these curves, clearly labeled with equations and parameters.
