<think>Got it, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the figure described. The main elements are: a large white circle with a smaller white circle inside, right angle at their intersection, an arrow to the larger circle's center, and two arrows (top and bottom) for axes.

First, I'll start by setting up the LaTeX document with the necessary packages. Tikz is needed, so I'll include \usepackage{tikz}. Then, the background is white, so maybe set the page color to white, or just use a white background in the Tikz picture.

Next, the large circle. Let's say the large circle has radius, maybe 2cm, centered at some point. The smaller circle inside should be smaller, maybe radius 1cm, centered at the same point as the large circle? Wait, the problem says "another smaller white circle inside it"—so maybe the smaller circle is centered at the same center as the larger one, or maybe offset? Wait, the intersection has a right angle, so maybe the smaller circle is offset such that the intersection is a right angle. Hmm, right angle at the intersection implies that the tangent lines at the intersection points form a right angle, which would mean the centers are separated by a distance such that the angle between the tangents is 90 degrees. Wait, the condition for two circles to intersect at a right angle is that the square of the distance between centers is equal to the sum of the squares of the radii. Wait, no, the condition for orthogonal circles (intersecting at right angles) is that the tangent lines at the intersection points are perpendicular, which means the radius of one circle is perpendicular to the radius of the other at the point of intersection. So, if we have two circles with centers O1 and O2, radii r1 and r2, then the line O1O2 is perpendicular to the tangent lines, so if the circles intersect at right angles, then the angle between O1O2 and the tangent is 90 degrees, meaning the angle between O1O2 and O1P (where P is intersection point) is 90 degrees. So, the dot product of vectors O1O2 and O1P is zero. But maybe for simplicity, let's assume the larger circle has center (0,0), radius R, the smaller circle has center (d,0), radius r, and they intersect at right angles. Then, the condition is that the tangent at the intersection point is perpendicular, so the radius of the first circle (from center to intersection point) is perpendicular to the radius of the second circle. So, the vector from (0,0) to (x,y) is (x,y), and from (d,0) to (x,y) is (x - d, y). Their dot product should be zero: x(x - d) + y*y = 0. But also, both points are on both circles: x² + y² = R² and (x - d)² + y² = r². Subtracting the second equation from the first: x² + y² - [(x - d)² + y²] = R² - r² → x² - (x² - 2dx + d²) = R² - r² → 2dx - d² = R² - r² → 2dx = R² - r² + d² → x = (R² - r² + d²)/(2d). Then, substituting back into x² + y² = R², we get y² = R² - x². But maybe for simplicity, let's set the larger circle radius as 2, smaller as 1, and center of smaller circle at (1,0), so distance between centers is 1. Then, check if they are orthogonal: the condition is that the product of the radii squared equals the square of the distance between centers? Wait, no, the condition for orthogonal circles is that the sum of the squares of the radii equals the square of the distance between centers? Wait, no, let's recall: two circles with radii r1, r2, distance between centers d, are orthogonal if r1² + r2² = d². Wait, let's test with R=2, r=1, d=1: 2² + 1² = 5, d²=1, not equal. So that's not orthogonal. Wait, maybe the condition is that the tangent lines are perpendicular, so the angle between the two radii at the intersection point is 90 degrees. So, the angle between O1P and O2P is 90 degrees, where O1 and O2 are centers, P is intersection point. So, triangle O1PO2 has a right angle at P. Therefore, O1P² + O2P² = O1O2². O1P is R, O2P is r, O1O2 is d. So R² + r² = d². Oh, right! That's the condition. So if R=2, r=1, then d²=5, d=√5. So centers are separated by √5. So the smaller circle is centered at (d,0) = (√5, 0), radius 1, larger circle at (0,0), radius 2. Then, the intersection points would form a right angle. But maybe for drawing simplicity, let's use coordinates where the larger circle is centered at (0,0), radius 2, smaller circle centered at (1,0), radius 1. Wait, but does that satisfy R² + r² = d²? 2² + 1² = 5, d=1, 1²=1, not equal. So that's not orthogonal. Hmm, maybe the problem says "the intersection of the two circles is marked with a right angle"—so the angle between the two circles at their intersection is a right angle, meaning the tangent lines are perpendicular. So the angle between the two tangent lines at the intersection point is 90 degrees. To achieve that, the condition is that the angle between the two radii (from each center to the intersection point) is 90 degrees. So, if the centers are O1 and O2, and P is an intersection point, then angle O1PO2 is 90 degrees. Therefore, O1P² + O2P² = O1O2². So R² + r² = d², where d is the distance between centers. So if we take R=2, r=1, then d=√(4+1)=√5. So centers at (0,0) and (√5,0), radii 2 and 1. Then, the intersection points would have angle 90 degrees. But drawing √5 might be messy, maybe use R=2, r=1, d=√5 ≈ 2.236. But maybe for the Tikz code, we can use coordinates with the larger circle centered at (0,0), radius 2, smaller circle centered at (d,0), radius 1, where d is such that R² + r² = d². So d = sqrt(2² + 1²) = sqrt(5). So the smaller circle is at (sqrt(5), 0), radius 1. Then, the intersection points would be where the two circles meet. But maybe instead of calculating exact coordinates, we can use relative positions. Alternatively, maybe the smaller circle is centered at the same center as the larger one, but then the intersection would be two points, but the right angle would be at the center? No, if both circles are centered at the same point, the intersection is two points, and the angle between the radii to those points would depend on the radii. Wait, if two circles have the same center, then they are concentric, and they don't intersect unless one is inside the other. But the problem says "another smaller white circle inside it"—so maybe the smaller circle is inside the larger one, centered at the same center. But then the intersection is the entire smaller circle, not a right angle. So that can't be. So back to the orthogonal circles. So let's proceed with the centers separated by sqrt(5), radii 2 and 1. Then, the larger circle is centered at (0,0), radius 2, smaller at (sqrt(5),0), radius 1. Then, the intersection points can be calculated, but maybe for drawing, we can use approximate coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows the smaller circle to be centered at (0,0) as well, but then the intersection is a circle, not a right angle. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for a simpler case: if the larger circle has center (0,0), radius 2, the smaller circle has center (1,0), radius 1. Even if they are not orthogonal, maybe the intersection has a right angle marked. But the problem says "the intersection of the two circles is marked with a right angle"—so the right angle is at the intersection points, so maybe the angle between the two circles' tangents at the intersection point is 90 degrees. So the tangent lines at the intersection point are perpendicular. To draw that, we need to have the tangent lines at the intersection point form a right angle. So the tangent of one circle at the intersection point is perpendicular to the tangent of the other circle. The tangent of a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So if the two radii (from each center to the intersection point) are not perpendicular, then the tangents (which are perpendicular to the radii) would form an angle equal to the angle between the radii. So if we want the tangents to be perpendicular, the radii must form a 90-degree angle. Therefore, the angle between the two radii (from each center to the intersection point) is 90 degrees. So, in triangle O1PO2, angle at P is 90 degrees. Therefore, O1P² + O2P² = O1O2². So R² + r² = d², where d is the distance between centers. So let's take R=2, r=1, then d=√(4+1)=√5. So centers at (0,0) and (√5,0), radii 2 and 1. Then, the intersection points can be found by solving the two circle equations: x² + y² = 4 and (x - √5)² + y² = 1. Subtracting the second from the first: x² + y² - [(x - √5)² + y²] = 4 - 1 → x² - (x² - 2√5 x + 5) = 3 → 2√5 x - 5 = 3 → 2√5 x = 8 → x = 4/√5 = (4√5)/5 ≈ 3.577/5 ≈ 0.714*5=3.57? Wait, 4/√5 is approximately 1.788, but wait, √5 is about 2.236, so 4/2.236 ≈ 1.788. Wait, but the center of the smaller circle is at √5 ≈ 2.236, so the intersection point is at x ≈ 1.788, which is between 0 and 2.236, so that makes sense. Then y² = 4 - x² ≈ 4 - (16/5) = 4 - 3.2 = 0.8, so y ≈ ±√0.8 ≈ ±0.894. So the intersection points are approximately (1.788, 0.894) and (1.788, -0.894). At these points, the tangent lines of each circle are perpendicular. So to mark a right angle at the intersection, we can draw a small square at one of the intersection points, indicating the right angle. Then, an arrow pointing towards the larger circle's center (which is (0,0)), so an arrow from the intersection point towards (0,0). Also, two arrows at the top and bottom, probably indicating the y-axis (up and down), so arrows at the top and bottom of the figure, maybe along the y-axis. The background is white, so the circles are white, the rest is white, so the Tikz picture will have white circles on a white background, with the right angle mark, arrows, etc. Now, let's start coding. First, the LaTeX document structure:

\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}
% Set the background color to white (though maybe not necessary if the default is white)
% But since the circles are white, the background is white, so maybe just draw the elements.
% Define the larger circle: center (0,0), radius 2
\fill[white] (0,0) circle (2);
% Define the smaller circle: center (sqrt(5),0), radius 1
\fill[white] (sqrt(5),0) circle (1);
% Mark the right angle at the intersection point. Let's take the top intersection point (1.788, 0.894) approximated as ( (4√5)/5, √(4 - (16/5)) ) = ( (4*2.236)/5, √(0.8) ) ≈ (3.577/5, 0.894) ≈ (0.715, 0.894). Wait, no, earlier calculation was x = 4/√5 = (4√5)/5 ≈ 1.788, y = √(4 - (16/5)) = √(4/5) = 2/√5 ≈ 0.894. So the intersection points are (4/√5, 2/√5) and (4/√5, -2/√5). So to mark a right angle, we can draw a small square at one of these points. Let's choose the top one: (4/√5, 2/√5). The right angle symbol is usually a small square, so draw a square with sides of small length, say 0.1, at that point. So:
\draw[thick] (4/√5, 2/√5) -- (4/√5 + 0.1, 2/√5) -- (4/√5 + 0.1, 2/√5 - 0.1) -- (4/√5, 2/√5 - 0.1) -- cycle;
% Arrow pointing to the larger circle's center (0,0). Let's draw an arrow from the intersection point (4/√5, 2/√5) to (0,0). Use \draw[->, thick] (intersection point) -- (0,0);
\draw[->, thick] (4/√5, 2/√5) -- (0,0);
% Arrows at the top and bottom, indicating axes. Let's draw an arrow at the top center (0, 2.5) pointing up, and at the bottom center (0, -2.5) pointing down. So:
\draw[->, thick] (0, 2.5) -- (0, 3);
\draw[->, thick] (0, -2.5) -- (0, -3);
% Wait, need to make sure the arrows are at the top and bottom of the figure. Maybe place them at (0, 2.5) and (0, -2.5), with arrows pointing up and down. Also, maybe the larger circle's radius is 2, so the top of the larger circle is at (0,2), so the top arrow could be at (0,2.5) pointing up, and bottom at (0,-2.5) pointing down. That way, they are outside the circles.
% Also, check if the circles are properly drawn. The larger circle is radius 2, so from (0,-2) to (0,2), and the smaller circle is radius 1, centered at (sqrt(5),0), so it extends from (sqrt(5)-1,0) to (sqrt(5)+1,0), which is approximately (1.236,0) to (3.236,0), and up/down by 1, so from (sqrt(5),-1) to (sqrt(5),1), which is approximately (2.236,-1) to (2.236,1). So the smaller circle is inside the larger one, centered at (2.236,0), radius 1, so it touches the larger circle at (1.236,0) and (3.236,0), but wait, the intersection points we calculated were at (1.788, ±0.894), which are between 1.236 and 3.236, so that makes sense.
% Now, let's adjust the coordinates to make the code cleaner. Instead of using sqrt(5), which is an irrational number, maybe use relative coordinates or approximate values. But for exactness, let's use the exact values. However, in Tikz, we can use sqrt(5) as a command. So:
\draw[thick] (4/sqrt(5), 2/sqrt(5)) -- (4/sqrt(5) + 0.1, 2/sqrt(5)) -- (4/sqrt(5) + 0.1, 2/sqrt(5) - 0.1) -- (4/sqrt(5), 2/sqrt(5) - 0.1) -- cycle;
\draw[->, thick] (4/sqrt(5), 2/sqrt(5)) -- (0,0);
\draw[->, thick] (0, 2.5) -- (0, 3);
\draw[->, thick] (0, -2.5) -- (0, -3);
% Also, make sure the circles are filled with white. The default fill color in Tikz is white, so if we use \fill[white]... it should work. Wait, the problem says "a white circle with another smaller white circle inside it"—so both circles are white, so filling them with white. The background is white, so the rest is white. So the code so far:
\fill[
