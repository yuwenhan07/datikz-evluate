<think>Got it, let's try to figure out this problem. The question is about an example where a set K doesn't satisfy a certain property, probably related to being closed or open, or maybe a topological property. The image description is a square on a white background with a circular boundary around it, the square is mostly inside the circle. 

First, let's recall what property^* might mean. Maybe "property" is something like being closed, open, or having certain boundary conditions. If K is the square, and the surrounding circle is the boundary. Suppose the property is that the closure of K is contained in the circle, or maybe being a compact set, or maybe something about being a subset with certain boundary. Wait, if the square is inside the circle, but maybe the property is that K is a closed set with empty interior? No, a square has non-empty interior. Wait, maybe the property is being a "closed" set in some topology, but if the square is not closed in some context? Wait, no, a square with its boundary is closed in standard topology. Wait, maybe the property is "being a compact set with empty interior"? But a square has non-empty interior. Hmm, maybe the property is "being a set whose boundary is contained in the circle", but if the square's boundary is exactly the circle? Wait, the image says the square occupies most of the space within the white circular boundary. So the square is inside the circle, but maybe the property is that K is a subset of the circle with the circle being the boundary. Wait, maybe the property is "K is a closed set with respect to the subspace topology of the circle". If the square is a subset of the circle, but if the square's closure in the plane includes points outside the circle, then maybe K is not closed in the circle's subspace. Wait, let's think step by step.

Suppose the property is "K is a closed set in the ambient space (like the plane)". If K is the square, then its closure is itself, which is closed. But if the property is something else, like "K is a compact set with empty interior", but the square has non-empty interior. Alternatively, maybe the property is "K is a set with empty interior", but the square has interior, so that's not it. Wait, the image shows a square inside a circle. Maybe the property is "K is a subset of the circle with K being a closed set in the circle's topology". If the square is considered as a subset of the circle (which is a subspace), then the square's closure in the circle would include the boundary of the square if the circle is the ambient space. Wait, maybe the example is that K (the square) is not a closed set in some topology, but in standard topology, it is. Alternatively, maybe the property is "K is a connected set", but a square is connected. Hmm, maybe the property is "K is a set with a boundary that is a subset of its complement", which doesn't make sense. Wait, let's think about the image again: a square on a white background, circular boundary around it, square is mostly inside the circle. Maybe the property is "K is a compact set with respect to the subspace topology of the plane", but that's always true if K is closed and bounded. Wait, maybe the property is "K is a set whose complement is connected", but the complement of the square (with the circle) might not be connected. Wait, I need to recall what "property^*" means. Maybe it's a typo for "property (P)" or "property P star", but without more context, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the property is "being a closed set with empty boundary", but a square has a non-empty boundary. Wait, if K is the square without its boundary (i.e., the interior), then its closure is the square, but the interior has empty boundary? No, the boundary of the interior is the square's boundary. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the property is "K is a set with a boundary that is a subset of the circle", but if the square's boundary is not entirely on the circle, but the image says the square is inside the circle, so maybe the square's boundary is inside the circle, but if the property requires the boundary of K to be exactly the circle, then if the square's boundary is not the circle, then K doesn't satisfy it. Wait, if K is the square, and the circle is a larger set containing K, then the boundary of K is the square's perimeter, which is not the circle's perimeter unless the square is the circle, which it's not. So maybe the property is "the boundary of K is equal to the boundary of the circle", but since the square's boundary is smaller, K doesn't satisfy that. Alternatively, if the property is "K is a subset of the circle with K being closed in the circle", then if the square is not closed in the circle's subspace (if the circle has a different topology), but this is getting too vague. Wait, let's try to think of a standard example where a set doesn't satisfy a property. For example, if the property is "being a closed set", then an open set like the interior of the square (without the boundary) would not be closed, but the image shows a square, maybe including the boundary. Wait, the problem says "K not satisfying property^*", and the image is a square on a white background with a circular boundary. Maybe the property is "K is a compact set with empty interior", but the square has non-empty interior. Alternatively, if K is the square without the boundary (i.e., the open square), then its closure is the closed square, which is compact, but the open square is not closed, hence not compact in some topologies? Wait, in standard topology, open square is not compact, but closed square is. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the property is "K is a connected set with a connected complement", but the complement of the square (with the circle) might not be connected. Wait, I think I need to make an educated guess here. The image shows a square inside a circle, so maybe K is the square, and the property is "K is a subset of the circle with K being a closed set in the circle's subspace topology". If the square is not closed in the circle's subspace (if the circle has a different structure), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the property is "K is a compact set with non-empty interior", which the square satisfies, but if K is the interior of the square (open square), then it's not compact. Wait, the problem says "the image is a simple drawing of a square, which is placed on a white background, possibly a piece of paper. The square occupies most of the space within the white circular boundary that surrounds it." So the square is inside the circle, maybe the circle is the ambient space, and K is the square. If the property is "K is a closed set in the ambient space", then K is closed. If the property is "K is a set with empty interior", then K doesn't satisfy it. But the square has non-empty interior. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to recall that in topology, a set with empty interior is nowhere dense, but the square has non-empty interior. Alternatively, maybe the property is "K is a set whose boundary is empty", which would mean K is both open and closed (clopen), but a square's boundary is non-empty, so if K is the square including its boundary, then its boundary is the perimeter, which is non-empty, so K is not clopen unless the space is disconnected. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the property is "K is a compact set with no boundary", but every set has a boundary unless it's the entire space. Wait, I think I need to consider that the example is the square as a subset of the plane, and the property is "being a closed set with empty boundary", but the square has a boundary, so it doesn't satisfy that. Alternatively, if the property is "K is a set with a boundary contained in its complement", which would mean the boundary is empty, so K is open and closed. But the square's boundary is not in its complement (the complement includes the area outside the square, but the boundary is between the square and its complement, so the boundary is not in either, maybe). This is getting too vague. Wait, let's try to think of a standard example where a set doesn't satisfy a property. For example, the set of rational numbers in [0,1] is not compact (in standard topology), but that's not a square. Alternatively, the open square (without boundary) is not compact. But the image shows a closed square. Wait, the problem says "K not satisfying property^*", and the image is a square inside a circle. Maybe the property is "K is a subset of the circle with K being a closed set in the circle's topology", but if the square is not closed in the circle's subspace (if the circle has a different topology), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the property is "K is a connected set with a connected complement", but the complement of the square (which is inside the circle) might have a disconnected complement if the square is connected. Wait, I think I need to conclude that the example is the square (as a set) not being closed in some context, but since it's a closed set in standard topology, maybe the property is something else. Wait, another angle: if the property is "K is a compact set with empty interior", then the square doesn't satisfy it because it has non-empty interior. But if K is the interior of the square (open square), then it's not compact. But the image shows a square, maybe including the boundary. Hmm. Given the image description, the square is inside a circle, so maybe K is the square, and the property is "K is a subset of the circle with K being a closed set in the ambient space", which it is, but if the property is "K is a subset of the circle with K being a closed set in the circle's subspace", then it's closed. I'm stuck. Wait, maybe the property is "K is a set with a boundary that is a subset of the circle", but if the square's boundary is not entirely on the circle, then K doesn't satisfy it. For example, if the circle is larger than the square, the square's boundary is inside the circle, but if the property requires the boundary of K to be exactly the circle, then K (the square) doesn't have boundary equal to the circle. Alternatively, if the property is "K is a set whose boundary is empty", then K is the entire space, which it's not. Given that I need to provide an example where K doesn't satisfy the property, and the image is a square inside a circle, maybe the property is "K is a compact set with non-empty interior", but if K is the circle minus the square, then it might not be compact, but the question is about K being the square. Wait, I think I need to make a conclusion here. The example is likely the square (as a subset of the plane) not being a closed set in some non-standard topology, but since the image is a standard square, maybe the property is "being a connected set with a connected complement", but the complement of the square (with the circle) might not be connected. Alternatively, the square is a compact set, but if the property is "being a countable set", then it's not countable. But a square has uncountably many points. Hmm. Given the confusion, I'll assume that the property is "K is a closed set with empty interior", and the example is the interior of the square (open square), which is not closed, hence doesn't satisfy the property. But the image shows a closed square. Alternatively, if K is the square without its boundary (open square), then it's not closed, so it doesn't satisfy being a closed set. That might be the example. So the example is the open square (K) which is not closed, hence doesn't satisfy the property of being closed.</think><answer>To provide an example where a set \( K \) does not satisfy a given property, consider \( K \) as the **interior of a square** (i.e., the open square without its boundary). The image depicts a square on a white background with a circular boundary; if \( K \) is the interior of the square, it occupies the "white" area inside the square but does not include the square's boundary.  

If the property in question is "being a closed set" (a common topological property), the interior of the square is not closed because its closure includes the boundary of the square, which is not part of \( K \). Thus, \( K \) fails to satisfy the closed-set property.  

The answer is \(<|begin_of_box|>K = \text{interior of the square} (open square)<|end_of_box|>\).</answer>
