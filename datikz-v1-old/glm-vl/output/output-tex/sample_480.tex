<think>Got it, let's try to parse this problem step by step. First, the question is about the first preprocessing step of PTAS (Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme) for some problem, probably a combinatorial optimization problem like set cover, knapsack, etc. But let's focus on the given conditions.

We have variables Y_2, Y_6, Y_42, Y_8, Y_9 with support value v_i = (1+)^k. Wait, maybe "support value" here refers to the value of the variable when it's 1, like in a knapsack problem where each variable has a weight and a value. But the notation (1+)^k might be a typo or specific notation. Maybe it's supposed to be something like 2^k or (1 + ε)^k? But let's assume that v_i is a value associated with each variable, and the support might refer to the set of variables with certain properties.

Then, it says Y_2 and Y_6 have probability of being non-zero at most ^20. Wait, "probability of being non-zero" – maybe in a probabilistic setting, like a random variable, the probability that Y_i is 1 is at most ^20. So for Y_2 and Y_6, Pr(Y_i = 1) ≤ ^20. Then, the total probability of variables in X_v_i^* is at most ^10, so those variables are ignored. X_v_i^* might be a set of variables associated with the v_i variables.

Let me try to structure the problem:

1. Identify the variables: Y_2, Y_6, Y_42, Y_8, Y_9 have support value v_i = (1+)^k. Maybe each of these variables has a value v_i, and the support could mean they are part of a set with certain properties. The notation (1+)^k might be a way to denote a value that's exponential in k, like 2^k or (1+ε)^k, but since it's (1+)^k, maybe it's a typo for 2^k or (1 + 1/k)^k? But without more context, it's hard, but let's proceed.

2. Y_2 and Y_6 have probability of being non-zero (i.e., probability that they are 1) at most ^20. So Pr(Y_2=1) ≤ ^20, Pr(Y_6=1) ≤ ^20. The other variables Y_42, Y_8, Y_9 might have higher probabilities, but the problem states these five variables have v_i = (1+)^k, while Y_2 and Y_6 have low probability.

3. The total probability of variables in X_v_i^* is at most ^10. If the total probability (sum of probabilities of variables in X_v_i^*) ≤ ^10, then those variables are ignored. So we need to check if the sum of probabilities of the variables with v_i = (1+)^k (which are Y_2, Y_6, Y_42, Y_8, Y_9) is ≤ ^10. But wait, Y_2 and Y_6 have probability ≤ ^20 each, and the others might have higher probabilities, but if the total is ≤ ^10, then we ignore them.

Wait, the problem says "the total probability of variables in X_v_i^* is at most ^10, the variables are ignored". So X_v_i^* is the set of variables with v_i = (1+)^k, which includes Y_2, Y_6, Y_42, Y_8, Y_9. The total probability of these variables (i.e., sum of their probabilities of being non-zero) is ≤ ^10, so we ignore them.

But wait, Y_2 and Y_6 have probability ≤ ^20 each. If there are, say, 5 variables in X_v_i^*, and each of Y_2 and Y_6 has probability ≤ ^20, and the others (Y_42, Y_8, Y_9) might have probabilities, but if the total sum is ≤ ^10, then we ignore them. So maybe the idea is that if the total probability is small (≤ ^10), then those variables don't contribute much to the objective, so we can ignore them in the approximation.

Now, to summarize the steps for the first preprocessing:

- Identify variables with support value v_i = (1+)^k: Y_2, Y_6, Y_42, Y_8, Y_9.
- For Y_2 and Y_6, check their probability of being non-zero: ≤ ^20 each.
- Calculate the total probability of all variables in X_v_i^* (i.e., the five variables) by summing their probabilities. If this total ≤ ^10, then ignore these variables for the rest of the process.

This is likely a preprocessing step to reduce the problem size by eliminating variables that contribute too little to the objective, given their low probability or small support value, which allows the PTAS to focus on more relevant variables.

Now, to make sure I'm not missing anything: the notation (1+)^k might be a specific term, maybe (1 + ε)^k, where ε is a small constant, common in PTAS where ε is the approximation factor. If (1+)^k is (1 + ε)^k, then as k increases, this grows exponentially, but if the probability is small (like ^20), maybe the product of probability and support value is small, so when summed, if total is ≤ ^10, they are ignored.

Another angle: in PTAS, preprocessing often involves rounding or eliminating variables that are unlikely to be part of the optimal solution, especially if their contribution is negligible. Here, variables with low probability (≤ ^20) and small support (v_i = (1+)^k, which might be small if k is small, but if k is large, maybe not) might have a combined total probability too small (≤ ^10), so they're ignored.

So the conclusion is that if the total probability of the variables with specified support and low probability is ≤ ^10, those variables are ignored in the subsequent steps of the PTAS.</think><answer>To analyze the first preprocessing step of the PTAS, we break down the given conditions and their implications:  

1. **Identify Variables with Specified Properties**:  
   Variables \( Y_2, Y_6, Y_{42}, Y_8, Y_9 \) have a "support value" \( v_i = (1+)^k \). Additionally, \( Y_2 \) and \( Y_6 \) have a probability of being non-zero (i.e., \( Y_i = 1 \)) at most \( ^{20} \).  

2. **Total Probability Check**:  
   The set \( X_{v_i}^* \) includes all variables with \( v_i = (1+)^k \) (i.e., \( Y_2, Y_6, Y_{42}, Y_8, Y_9 \)). The total probability of these variables (sum of their probabilities of being non-zero) is calculated. If this total is at most \( ^{10} \), the variables are ignored.  

3. **Implications for PTAS Preprocessing**:  
   Variables with low probability (≤ \( ^{20} \)) and small combined total probability (≤ \( ^{10} \)) are deemed negligible for the problem’s objective. Ignoring them reduces the problem size, allowing the PTAS to focus on more relevant variables.  

In summary, the preprocessing step eliminates variables with low probability and small combined contribution, as their total probability is insufficient to affect the solution significantly.
