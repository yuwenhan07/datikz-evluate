<think>Got it, let's try to figure out this problem. The question is about an impossible case where one endpoint of an ear P_i (which has 3 edges) is an internal vertex of another ear P_j (also with 3 edges). We need to visualize or describe such a configuration and explain why it's impossible.

First, let's recall what an ear is. An ear in a polygon is a sequence of three edges that form a "triangle" or a path of three edges, with the endpoints on the boundary of the polygon, and the internal vertices not on the boundary. Wait, more precisely, an ear is a set of three edges forming a triangle where the two endpoints are on the polygon's boundary, and the third vertex is inside. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the definitions.

Let's denote the ears: P_i has 3 edges, let's say the endpoints are v1, v2, v3, v4 (so three edges: v1v2, v2v3, v3v4, making a path of three edges, so the internal vertices are v2 and v3). Then P_j has 3 edges, say endpoints w1, w2, w3, w4 (edges w1w2, w2w3, w3w4), with internal vertices w2, w3. The problem states that one endpoint of P_i is an internal vertex of P_j. Let's say, for example, that v2 (an internal vertex of P_i) is an internal vertex of P_j. So v2 is one of w2 or w3 (the internal vertices of P_j). Suppose v2 = w2. Then P_j's edges would include w1w2 (which is v1v2 if v1=w1), w2w3 (which is v2v3), and w3w4 (which is v3v4). Wait, but then P_j would have edges w1w2, w2w3, w3w4, which are the same as P_i's edges if w1=v1, w4=v4. But then P_i and P_j would be the same ear, which can't be because they are different ears. Alternatively, if v2 is an internal vertex of P_j, say v2 = w3, then P_j's edges would be w1w2, w2w3 (which is v2v3), w3w4. But then the internal vertices of P_j are w2 and w3 (v2 and v3), so P_j would have edges connecting w1 to w2 (maybe v1 to v2), w2 to v2 (v2 to v3), and v3 to w4. But this might create a situation where the ears overlap in a way that violates the polygon's structure.

Alternatively, let's think about the polygon's structure. If P_i and P_j are both ears with 3 edges, their internal vertices should be part of the polygon's interior. If one internal vertex of P_i is an internal vertex of P_j, say vertex x is in both ears, then the ears P_i and P_j would share the vertex x, and their edges might form a larger structure. But if both are ears with 3 edges, the combined structure might create a quadrilateral or a triangle that's not possible. Wait, another approach: in a polygon, an ear is a triangle-like structure, and if two ears share an internal vertex, the edges around that vertex might form a polygon with too many edges or a non-convex structure, which might not be possible.

Wait, let's consider the specific case where P_j has a dashed edge H_j-1 (maybe the first edge of P_j is dashed), thick lines are P_j, normal lines are P_i, dotted lines are R (the remaining polygon). Suppose P_i is an ear with endpoints on the polygon's boundary, and one of its endpoints is an internal vertex of P_j. But an internal vertex of an ear should be inside the polygon, so if it's an internal vertex of P_j, then P_j must have that vertex as one of its internal vertices (not on the boundary). But if P_j is an ear with 3 edges, its endpoints are on the polygon's boundary, so its internal vertices are inside. If P_i's endpoint is an internal vertex of P_j, then that vertex is inside the polygon, but P_i's endpoint is supposed to be on the polygon's boundary. Wait, there's a contradiction here: an endpoint of an ear (which is on the boundary) cannot be an internal vertex (which is inside) of another ear. Because internal vertices of ears are not on the boundary, while endpoints of ears are on the boundary. Therefore, the case where an endpoint of P_i (which is on the boundary) is an internal vertex of P_j (which is inside) is impossible. That must be the key point. So the impossibility arises because endpoints of ears are on the polygon's boundary, while internal vertices of ears are inside, so they can't be the same point. Therefore, such a configuration where an endpoint (on boundary) is an internal vertex (inside) of another ear is impossible.</think><answer>The problem involves an impossible configuration where an endpoint of an ear \( P_i \) (with 3 edges) is an internal vertex of another ear \( P_j \) (also with 3 edges). An ear's endpoints lie on the polygon's boundary, while its internal vertices lie inside the polygon. Since an endpoint of \( P_i \) is on the boundary and an internal vertex of \( P_j \) is inside, they cannot coincide. This contradiction—boundary points and interior points cannot be the same—makes the configuration impossible.
