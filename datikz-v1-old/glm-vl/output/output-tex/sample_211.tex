<think>Got it, let's try to parse this question. The user is talking about representing \( ^n \) (maybe a superscript n, like \( f^n \) or something) in the (,f)-plane, left, and its profile \( x^n(t, \cdot) \) at time t > 0 sufficiently small, right. They mention shock and rarefaction fronts as dashed and solid thick lines. 

First, I need to recall what WFT notations might refer toâ€”maybe Wave Front Transform? But the question is about the representation of a function or a solution in the (,f)-plane, which sounds like a phase plane or a space-time diagram. The left part is the (,f)-plane, maybe a diagram showing the evolution, and the right is the profile at a small time t > 0. 

Shock and rarefaction fronts: in hyperbolic conservation laws, shock waves are discontinuities with a certain speed, and rarefaction waves are continuous solutions with fan-like structures. The (,f)-plane might represent some variables, maybe the state variable and its derivative, or space and time. The dashed lines for shock (discontinuity) and solid thick for rarefaction (continuous) make sense. 

But the question is probably asking for a description or explanation of how this representation works, given the elements mentioned. Since the user says "representation of ^n as in ~f:WFTnotations", maybe \( ^n \) is a sequence of functions or solutions, and the (,f)-plane shows their behavior, with shock and rarefaction fronts indicated. The profile at small time t > 0 would show the initial development, maybe a rarefaction if the initial data has a fan, or a shock if there's a discontinuity. 

Wait, the user might be referring to a standard diagram in fluid dynamics or PDEs, where the (,f)-plane could be (x,t) or (u,t), but the question says (,f)-plane, maybe (space, frequency) or (state, flux). The key points are the representation in the plane with shock (dashed) and rarefaction (solid thick) lines, and the profile at small time. 

Since the question is about describing the representation, maybe the answer should explain that in the (,f)-plane (probably a phase plane or space-time diagram), the shock front is a discontinuity (dashed line) and rarefaction is a continuous fan (solid thick), and the profile at small time shows the initial behavior, maybe a rarefaction wave starting to form or a shock propagating. 

But since the user might want a summary of the representation, the key elements are the (,f)-plane with shock (dashed) and rarefaction (solid thick) lines, and the profile at small time showing the early time behavior. Maybe the answer is a description of how these elements are represented, but since it's a question about representation, perhaps the final answer is a description or a diagram description, but since it's a text-based question, maybe the key is identifying the components: (,f)-plane with shock (dashed) and rarefaction (solid thick), and the profile at small time. 

Wait, the question says "put the final answer in a box", so maybe the final answer is a summary statement about the representation, but given the complexity, perhaps the key is recognizing the elements: shock as dashed, rarefaction as solid thick, in the (,f)-plane, and the profile at small time. But without more specific info, maybe the answer is a description of the representation as described, but since it's a question about representation, the box might contain the description of the elements. However, given the user's instruction, maybe the final answer is a statement like "The representation shows the (,f)-plane with shock fronts as dashed lines and rarefaction fronts as solid thick lines, and the profile \( x^n(t, \cdot) \) at small time t > 0." But need to make sure. Alternatively, if it's a specific diagram, but since it's a text description, the final answer in a box might be the key elements.</think><answer>The representation in the (,f)-plane (left) includes shock fronts depicted as dashed lines and rarefaction fronts as solid thick lines. The profile \( x^n(t, \cdot) \) at time \( t > 0 \) (right) shows the early-time behavior, with the structure of the solution influenced by the shock and rarefaction characteristics indicated in the plane.  

The answer is \(<|begin_of_box|>\text{Representation with shock fronts (dashed) and rarefaction fronts (solid thick) in the (,f)-plane, and profile } x^n(t, \cdot) \text{ at small } t > 0<|end_of_box|>\).</answer>
