<think>Got it, I need to illustrate the observable and non-observable points for the trajectory a(t) = (0.5t, 0.5t, 0) where t is between 0 and 2, in the xOy plane. First, let's understand the trajectory. The parametric equations are x = 0.5t, y = 0.5t, z = 0. Since z is 0, it's a straight line in the xOy plane. When t goes from 0 to 2, x and y both go from 0 to 1, because 0.5*0 = 0 and 0.5*2 = 1. So the trajectory is a line segment from (0,0) to (1,1) in the xOy plane.

Now, the observable points are those not intersected by the trajectory, and the non-observable are those intersected. Wait, the problem says "the green area removes the portion that intersects trajectory" – so maybe the observable area is the region not covered by the trajectory, and the non-observable is the area covered by the trajectory? Wait, need to clarify. The question is about observable (green area removes the portion intersecting the trajectory) and non-observable (red area). So probably, the green area is the set of points not intersected by the trajectory, and red is the set intersected. But the trajectory is a line segment, so the area intersected would be the line segment itself, and the observable area is the rest of the plane minus the line segment.

But in the xOy plane, the trajectory is a straight line from (0,0) to (1,1). So the observable points would be all points not on this line segment, and non-observable are the points on the line segment. But the problem says "illustration", so maybe we need to describe the regions. Alternatively, if the observable area is the region that can be seen without the trajectory blocking, but maybe the problem is about visibility, like if the trajectory is a line, then points not on the line are observable, and those on the line are non-observable. But the question mentions "the green area removes the portion that intersects trajectory" – so green area is the observable, which excludes the trajectory, and red is the non-observable, which includes the trajectory. Wait, the wording is "green area removes the portion that intersects trajectory" – so the green area is the area where the trajectory is removed, meaning the observable is the green area, which doesn't include the trajectory, and red is the non-observable, which includes the trajectory. So the observable points are all points not on the trajectory, and non-observable are the points on the trajectory.

To describe the trajectory: parametric equations x = 0.5t, y = 0.5t, t ∈ [0,2], so when t=0, (0,0); t=2, (1,1). So the line goes from the origin to (1,1) in the xOy plane. The observable area would be the entire plane minus this line segment, colored green, and the non-observable is the line segment colored red. But since it's an illustration, maybe we need to describe the regions in terms of coordinates. Alternatively, if considering a region around the trajectory, but the problem says "in the xOy plane", so the trajectory is a straight line from (0,0) to (1,1). The observable points are all points (x,y) not on the line y = x for x between 0 and 1, and non-observable are the points on y = x with x between 0 and 1.

Wait, but the problem says "the green area removes the portion that intersects trajectory" – so the green area is the set of points not intersected by the trajectory, meaning the observable region is the area excluding the trajectory, and red is the area including the trajectory. So the illustration would show the xOy plane with a green region everywhere except the line segment from (0,0) to (1,1), which is red. The trajectory is the line segment, so the non-observable (red) is the line itself, and observable (green) is the rest of the plane.

To confirm, the trajectory is a straight line, so its intersection with any area is just the line segment. Therefore, the observable area is the entire plane minus the line segment, colored green, and the non-observable is the line segment, colored red. The key is to describe this in the context of the problem, which is about the xOy plane, so the illustration would show the line from (0,0) to (1,1) as the red area (non-observable), and the rest of the plane as green (observable).</think><answer>The trajectory \( a(t) = (0.5t, 0.5t, 0) \) for \( t \in [0, 2] \) is a straight line segment in the xOy plane connecting the points \((0, 0)\) and \((1, 1)\). The observable points (green area) are all points in the xOy plane not on this line segment, while the non-observable points (red area) are precisely the points on the line segment itself. The illustration would show the green region covering the entire plane except for the red line segment from \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 1)\), indicating that the trajectory blocks visibility only along its path.  

The answer is \(<|begin_of_box|>(0,0) \text{ to } (1,1) \text{ line segment (red), rest green}<|end_of_box|>\).</answer>
