Certainly! Below is a TikZ LaTeX code that generates a visual representation of a musical staff with the specified pattern of dots and dashes. Each line of the staff will have a different number of dots and dashes, as described.

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]

% Draw the staff lines
\draw (0,0) -- (0,-4);
\draw (0,-1) -- (0,-3);
\draw (0,-2) -- (0,-2);

% Add numbers below each line
\node at (-1,-0.5) {1};
\node at (-1,-1.5) {2};
\node at (-1,-2.5) {3};
\node at (-1,-3.5) {4};

% Draw the dots and dashes for each line
\foreach \y in {-0.75,-1.75,-2.75} {
    \fill (\y,0) circle (0.05);
    \fill (\y,-1) circle (0.05);
    \fill (\y,-2) circle (0.05);
}

\foreach \y in {-0.25,-1.25,-2.25} {
    \fill (\y,-1) circle (0.05);
    \fill (\y,-2) circle (0.05);
    \fill (\y,-3) circle (0.05);
}

\foreach \y in {-0.5,-1.5,-2.5} {
    \fill (\y,-2) circle (0.05);
    \fill (\y,-3) circle (0.05);
}

\foreach \y in {-0.75,-1.75,-2.75} {
    \fill (\y,-3) circle (0.05);
}

% Add dashes between lines
\foreach \y in {-0.5,-1.5,-2.5} {
    \draw[dashed] (\y,-0.5) -- (\y,-1.5);
    \draw[dashed] (\y,-1.5) -- (\y,-2.5);
    \draw[dashed] (\y,-2.5) -- (\y,-3.5);
}
