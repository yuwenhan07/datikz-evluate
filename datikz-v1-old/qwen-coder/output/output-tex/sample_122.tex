To create a TikZ LaTeX diagram that visualizes the average relative loss with mean absolute deviations as a function of \( K \), we can use the `pgfplots` package in LaTeX. Below is an example of how you might generate this diagram:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.16}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        title={Average Relative Loss vs. $K$},
        xlabel={$K$},
        ylabel={Average Relative Loss},
        xmin=1,
        xmax=50,
        ymin=0,
        ymax=1,
        xtick=data,
        grid=major,
        width=10cm,
        height=6cm,
        legend pos=north west,
        ybar interval=2pt
    ]
        
        % Example data points
        \addplot coordinates {(1,0.1) (2,0.15) (3,0.18) (4,0.2) (5,0.22)
                             (6,0.24) (7,0.26) (8,0.28) (9,0.3) (10,0.32)
                             (11,0.34) (12,0.36) (13,0.38) (14,0.4) (15,0.42)
                             (16,0.44) (17,0.46) (18,0.48) (19,0.5) (20,0.52)
                             (21,0.54) (22,0.56) (23,0.58) (24,0.6) (25,0.62)
                             (26,0.64) (27,0.66) (28,0.68) (29,0.7) (30,0.72)
                             (31,0.74) (32,0.76) (33,0.78) (34,0.8) (35,0.82)
