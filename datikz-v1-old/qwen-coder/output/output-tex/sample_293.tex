To create a TikZ LaTeX diagram representing the transformation from \( K_{1,3} \) to \( T \), where each node represents a size-2 stable set of the original graph, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Original Graph \( K_{1,3} \)**:
   - \( K_{1,3} \) is a star graph with one central vertex connected to three other vertices.
   - The central vertex is called \( v_0 \), and the three outer vertices are \( v_1, v_2, \) and \( v_3 \).

2. **Replace an Edge by a Path \( P_4 \)**:
   - We replace one of the edges connecting \( v_0 \) to one of the outer vertices (say \( v_1 \)) with a path \( P_4 \).
   - This means we add two new vertices \( v_{11} \) and \( v_{12} \) between \( v_0 \) and \( v_1 \).

3. **Form the New Tree \( T \)**:
   - The new graph \( T \) will have the following structure:
     - Central vertex \( v_0 \)
     - Three outer vertices \( v_2 \) and \( v_3 \)
     - Two new vertices \( v_{11} \) and \( v_{12} \) forming a path between \( v_0 \) and \( v_1 \)

4. **Represent Size-2 Stable Sets**:
   - A size-2 stable set in a graph is a subset of vertices such that no two vertices in the subset are adjacent.
   - For \( K_{1,3} \), the size-2 stable sets are:
     - \( \{v_1, v_2\} \)
     - \( \{v_1, v_3\} \)
     - \( \{v_2, v_3\} \)
   - For \( T \), the size-2 stable sets include those from \( K_{1,3} \) plus additional sets formed by the new path:
     - \( \{v_1, v_{11}\} \)
     - \( \{v_1, v_{12}\} \)
     - \( \{v_{11}, v_{12}\} \)

5. **Draw the
