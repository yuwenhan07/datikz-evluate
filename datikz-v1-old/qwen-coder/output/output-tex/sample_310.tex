To generate the desired TikZ LaTeX code for the described process, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define the graph \( T_1 \).
2. Replace each edge of \( T_1 \) with a copy of \( U \).
3. Glue the first vertex \( u \) of \( U \) to the last vertex \( v \) of \( U \) along the exterior face.

Let's start by defining the graphs \( T_1 \) and \( U \). For simplicity, let's assume \( T_1 \) is a triangle (a cycle of 3 vertices) and \( U \) is a square (a cycle of 4 vertices).

Here is the TikZ LaTeX code to achieve this:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
    % Define the vertices of T1
    \node[draw, circle] (T1v1) at (0,0) {};
    \node[draw, circle] (T1v2) at (2,0) {};
    \node[draw, circle] (T1v3) at (1,-1.732) {};

    % Draw the edges of T1
    \draw (T1v1) -- (T1v2);
    \draw (T1v2) -- (T1v3);
    \draw (T1v3) -- (T1v1);

    % Define the vertices of U
    \node[draw, circle] (Uv1) at (4,0) {};
    \node[draw, circle] (Uv2) at (6,0) {};
    \node[draw, circle] (Uv3) at (5,-1.732) {};
    \node[draw, circle] (Uv4) at (4,-1.732) {};

    % Draw the edges of U
    \draw (Uv1) -- (Uv2);
    \draw (Uv2) -- (Uv3);
    \draw (Uv3) -- (Uv4);
    \draw (Uv4) -- (Uv1);

    % Translate U to position it next to T1
    \foreach \x in {1,...,4} {
        \node[
