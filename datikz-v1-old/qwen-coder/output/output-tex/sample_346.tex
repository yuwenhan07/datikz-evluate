Certainly! Below is an example of a TikZ LaTeX diagram that represents a square divided into smaller squares, each containing a number, and the numbers are connected by lines to form a specific pattern.

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
    % Define the size of the main square
    \def\squareSize{4cm}
    
    % Draw the main square
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (\squareSize,\squareSize);
    
    % Define the grid points
    \foreach \x in {0, 1, 2, 3} {
        \foreach \y in {0, 1, 2, 3} {
            \fill (\x*\squareSize/3, \y*\squareSize/3) circle (2pt);
        }
    }
    
    % Label the squares with numbers
    \node at (0.25, 1.75) {1};
    \node at (0.75, 1.75) {2};
    \node at (1.25, 1.75) {3};
    \node at (0.25, 1.25) {4};

    \node at (0.75, 0.75) {8};
    \node at (1.25, 0.75) {9};
