Here's some sample TikZ code that could generate an image similar to what you described:
```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
% Draw whiteboard background
\fill[white] (0,-4) rectangle (8,4);
% Write expressions and equations on whiteboard
\node at (1,3) {E\_2-page};
\node at (1,2) {of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch};
\node at (1,1) {spectral sequence};
\node at (1,0) {of Enriques surface};
\node at (1,-1) {X over $\mathbb{F}_q$};
\node at (3,-2) {$0$};
\node at (4,-2) {$1$};
\node at (5,-2) {$2$};
\node at (6,-2) {$-1$};
\node at (3,-3) {\frac{1}{2}};
\node at (4,-3) {\frac{3}{4}};
\node at (5,-3) {$(x+y)$};
\node at (6,-3) {$(a-b)^2$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{document}
```
This code creates a simple whiteboard background and writes several expressions and equations on it using nodes. You can customize the code further to add more details or modify the layout of the whiteboard as needed.
