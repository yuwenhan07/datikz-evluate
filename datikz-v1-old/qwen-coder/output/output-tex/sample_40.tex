Certainly! Below is a TikZ LaTeX code that generates a visual representation of a bipartite graph \( G \) with no proper edge coloring respecting certain forbidden colors. The code includes several black and white triangles of various sizes and positions, oriented differently to create an abstract and visually interesting scene.

```latex
