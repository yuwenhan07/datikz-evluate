This is some text: \textcolor{red}{foo}.
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture, overlay]
    \draw[red, line width=3pt, ->] (current page.text area.south west) -- ++(0.5, 0.5);
\end{tikzpicture}
And this is some text in between that the filling partially covers.
And this is another node: \textcolor{red}{bar}.
