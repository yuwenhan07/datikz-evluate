It seems like you're describing a process in graph theory or geometric topology, possibly related to constructing a new graph \(A_1\) from an initial graph \(T_1\). Let's break down the steps:

1. **Exchanging Edges of \(T_1\) by Copies of \(U\):**
   - Suppose \(T_1\) is a graph with some specific structure.
   - You replace certain edges of \(T_1\) with copies of another graph \(U\).
   - This operation can be thought of as replacing a subgraph of \(T_1\) with multiple instances of \(U\).

2. **Creating \(A_1\):**
   - After performing the edge exchanges, the resulting graph is denoted as \(A_1\).
   - This step involves modifying \(T_1\) according to the rules specified (i.e., replacing edges with copies of \(U\)).

3. **Obtaining Map \(B\):**
   - The map \(B\) is constructed by gluing the first vertex \(u\) and the last vertex \(v\) of \(A_1\) along the exterior face.
   - Gluing vertices means identifying them as a single point, effectively merging two vertices into one.
   - The "exterior face" refers to the outer boundary of the graph when it is embedded in a surface (like a plane or a sphere).

### Example:
Let's consider a simple example to illustrate this process:

- Suppose \(T_1\) is a graph consisting of a triangle (a cycle of 3 vertices) labeled \(u_1, u_2, u_3\).
- Suppose \(U\) is a graph with 2 vertices connected by an edge, labeled \(v_1, v_2\).
- Replace the edge between \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) with two copies of \(U\), so that the new graph \(A_1\) has the following structure: \(u_1 \to v_1 \to v_2 \to u_2 \to u_3 \to u_1\).

- Now, to construct \(B\):
  - Identify \(u_1\) and \(u_3\) as a single vertex.
  - The resulting graph \(B\) will have the structure: \(v_1 \to v_2 \to u_2 \to u_1 = u_3\).

This process can be more complex depending on the specific graphs \(T_1\) and \(U\), but the general idea remains the same: modify \(T_1\) by replacing edges with copies of \(U\), and then glue specific vertices together based on the given conditions.

If you have a specific graph \(T_1\) and \(U\) in mind, please provide those details, and I can give a more precise example!
