It seems like you're describing a visual representation that includes a central circle with coordinates and symbols, which might be part of a mathematical or geometric diagram. However, your mention of "cube _n" and "cube in _5" suggests that there could be some confusion here. Let's break down what you've described:

1. **Cube _n**: This term is not standard in geometry or mathematics. It might refer to a specific type of cube or a cube in a particular dimension. If you meant something like "cube n-dimensional," this would typically refer to a hypercube (or tesseract) in n dimensions.

2. **Cube in _5**: This phrase is also unclear. If you mean a 5-dimensional cube, it would be called a 5-cube or a penteract. A 5-cube has 32 vertices, 80 edges, 80 square faces, 40 cubic cells, and 10 tesseract 4-faces.

Given the description of the image:
- The central circle with coordinates and symbols could represent a point in space or a specific location within a coordinate system.
- The four coordinates labeled with numbers around the circle suggest a 4-dimensional coordinate system, where each number represents a coordinate axis.
- The symbols and numbers outside the circle might be additional data points, vectors, or components of a mathematical expression related to the coordinates.

If you have more details about the context or if you need help interpreting any specific part of the image, please provide more information!
