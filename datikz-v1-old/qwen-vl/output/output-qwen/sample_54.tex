It seems like you're describing a specific type of graph coloring problem involving paths and dashed edges in a graph \(D_{i-1}\). Let's break down the components:

1. **Graph \(D_{i-1}\)**: This is likely a graph that has been defined or constructed up to step \(i-1\).

2. **Fragment of Graph \(D_{i-1}\)**: A part of the graph \(D_{i-1}\) is being referred to as "dashed." This suggests that this particular part of the graph might be highlighted or marked differently for some reason.

3. **Path \(P_i\)**: There is a path \(P_i\) which is drawn using "normal lines." This indicates that the path \(P_i\) is represented in a standard way, without any special markings or colors.

4. **Colors of Edges**: The numbers 1, 2, and 3 represent different colors assigned to the edges of the graph. These colors could be used to distinguish between different parts of the graph or to solve a coloring problem where each edge must be colored with one of these three colors such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.

### Possible Interpretation:
Given the description, it appears you are dealing with a graph coloring problem where certain parts of the graph (specifically the fragment of \(D_{i-1}\)) are marked or colored differently from the rest of the graph. The path \(P_i\) is drawn normally, suggesting it might not be part of the coloring problem but rather a separate element to consider.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Identify the Fragment**: Determine what exactly the fragment of \(D_{i-1}\) is. This could be a subgraph, a specific set of vertices, or a particular structure within \(D_{i-1}\).

2. **Coloring the Fragment**: Apply the coloring rules (using colors 1, 2, and 3) to the fragment. Ensure that no two adjacent edges in the fragment share the same color.

3. **Consider Path \(P_i\)**: Since \(P_i\) is drawn with normal lines, it does not seem to be part of the coloring problem itself. However, if there are any intersections or connections between \(P_i\) and the fragment, ensure they are handled according to the coloring rules.

4. **Verify the Solution**: Double-check that all edges in the fragment are correctly colored and that the coloring respects the constraints of the problem.

If you have more specific details about the graph \(D_{i-1}\), the fragment, and the path \(P_i\), please provide them so I can give a more detailed solution.
