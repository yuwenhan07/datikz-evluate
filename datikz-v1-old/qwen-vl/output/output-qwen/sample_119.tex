The description you've provided seems to be describing a visual pattern that could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context or the medium used to create it. Here's a breakdown of what this might represent:

1. **Visual Representation**: The image consists of a white background with evenly spaced, thin, vertical lines in red and blue. These lines extend across the entire width of the image, suggesting a sense of depth or layers.

2. **Interpretation as Layers**: The mention of "four layers of states" could imply a conceptual or abstract representation rather than a literal depiction. In art or design, layers can refer to different elements or states within a composition. For example:
   - **Layer 1 (Red Lines)**: Could represent one state or condition.
   - **Layer 2 (Blue Lines)**: Could represent another state or condition.
   - **Layer 3 (White Background)**: Could represent a neutral or base state.
   - **Layer 4 (Combined Layers)**: Could represent a combined or transitional state.

3. **Possible Contexts**:
   - **Artistic Interpretation**: This could be part of an abstract painting or digital artwork where the lines symbolize different emotional states, physical states, or even technological states.
   - **Design Concept**: It could be a design concept for a user interface, where each layer represents a different stage of interaction or process.
   - **Educational Diagram**: It might be a simplified diagram used in educational materials to illustrate concepts like states in physics, biology, or computer science.

4. **Visual Effect**: The evenly spaced lines create a rhythmic and repetitive pattern, which can be visually engaging. This kind of pattern often draws the viewer's eye horizontally, creating a sense of movement or flow.
