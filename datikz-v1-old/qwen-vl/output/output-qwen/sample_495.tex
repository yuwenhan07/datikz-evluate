To solve the problem, we need to understand the conditions under which White can pass back certain components and how these conditions relate to the zones.

First, let's define the zones and the components:
- Zones: \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\)
- Components: Any subset of these zones

White can pass back components if they come from specific sets of zones:
- \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)
- \(\{3, 4, 5\}\)
- \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\)

The problem states that any set of four components will fall into at least one of these three cases. This means that if we have four components, they must be either all in zone 1, 2, and 3, or all in zone 3, 4, and 5, or all in zone 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Let's verify this with an example:
Consider the set of four components \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\). This set includes components from zones 1, 2, 3, and 4. We can see that it falls into the case \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) because it includes components from zones 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, White can pass back these components.

Similarly, consider the set of four components \(\{3, 4, 5, 1\}\). This set includes components from zones 3, 4, 5, and 1. It falls into the case \(\{3, 4, 5\}\) because it includes components from zones 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, White can pass back these components.

Finally, consider the set of four components \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\). This set includes components from zones 1, 2, 4, and 5. It falls into the case \(\{1, 2, 4, 5\}\) because it includes components from zones 1, 2, 4, and 5. Therefore, White can pass back these components.

Since any set of four components will fall into at least one of these three cases, White can always pass back the components if they form a set of four components. The condition that W does not contain two components from zones 1, 3, or 5 is irrelevant to the ability to pass back components based on the given sets.

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{White can always pass back the components if they form a set of four components.}}
\]
