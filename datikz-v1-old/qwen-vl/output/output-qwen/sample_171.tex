The provided text appears to describe a specific step in a construction process involving graph theory or network flow problems, where blocks are represented as cycles and vertices are cut vertices. Let's break down the information given:

### Notation and Definitions:
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)} \): A set of blocks (cycles) at stage 4.
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)}_B \): The value associated with block \( B \) at stage 4.
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)}_A \): The value associated with block \( A \) at stage 4.

### Initial Conditions:
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)} = \{B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4\} \)
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)}_{B_i} = 1 \) for \( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \)
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)}_{A_1} = -1 \)
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)}_{A_2} = -2 \)
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)}_{A_3} = -2 \)
- \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)}_{B} = 0 \) for all other blocks \( B \)

### Blocks and Their Representations:
- Blocks \( B_5 \) and \( A_4 \) are highlighted with thicker borders.
- Blocks in \( \mathcal{I}^{(4)} \) are colored blue.
- Blocks in \( P \) are colored orange.

### Candidates for Block \( A_4 \):
- The candidates for block \( A_4 \) are the three blocks belonging to \( P \) and the block \( B' \).

### Update Rules:
- Set \( \mathcal{I}^{(5)}_{B_5} = 1 \).
- Set \( \mathcal{I}^{(5)}_{A_4} = -1 \).
- For all other blocks \( B \) except \( B_5 \) and \( A_4 \), set \( \mathcal{I}^{(5)}_{B} = \mathcal{I}^{(4)}_{B} \).

### Summary:
This step involves updating the values of certain blocks based on the current state (\( \mathcal{I}^{(4)} \)) and introducing new blocks \( B_5 \) and \( A_4 \). The values assigned to these blocks reflect their importance or contribution in the current stage of the construction process. The candidates for \( A_4 \) are determined from the blocks in \( P \) and potentially another block \( B' \), which might be part of the problem's constraints or rules.

This type of construction is often used in algorithms related to network flows, graph theory, or optimization problems where blocks represent different components or resources, and the values associated with them indicate their status or contribution.
