It seems like you're referring to some specific mathematical or computational context, possibly related to linear algebra or matrix operations. Let's break down what you've mentioned:

1. **H'** and **H''**: These appear to be submatrices of a larger matrix \( H \). The notation \( H' \) and \( H'' \) suggests that these are different parts of the matrix \( H \).

2. **\( ^T_V' \)** and \( ^T_V'' \): These notations suggest that \( V' \) and \( V'' \) are vectors (or matrices), and the superscript \( T \) indicates the transpose operation. So, \( ^T_V' \) and \( ^T_V'' \) are transposes of vectors \( V' \) and \( V'' \), respectively.

3. **E**: This is likely another matrix or vector in the context of the operation being performed on \( H \).

4. **H^T**: This denotes the transpose of the matrix \( H \).

Given this information, it looks like you might be discussing how certain submatrices of the transpose of \( H \) are formed by multiplying the transpose of vectors with another matrix \( E \):

- \( H' = ^T_V' \cdot E \)
- \( H'' = ^T_V'' \cdot E \)

### Interpretation:
- \( ^T_V' \) and \( ^T_V'' \) are the transposes of vectors \( V' \) and \( V'' \).
- \( E \) is a matrix or vector that is being multiplied with these transposes.
- The results \( H' \) and \( H'' \) are the products of these transposes with \( E \).

### Example:
If \( V' \) and \( V'' \) were column vectors, then \( ^T_V' \) and \( ^T_V'' \) would be row vectors. If \( E \) was a matrix, the multiplication \( ^T_V' \cdot E \) and \( ^T_V'' \cdot E \) would result in new matrices \( H' \) and \( H'' \), respectively.

### Conclusion:
Without more context, it's hard to provide a more detailed explanation. However, the key points are:
- \( H' \) and \( H'' \) are derived from the transpose of vectors \( V' \) and \( V'' \) multiplied by a matrix \( E \).
- This operation could be part of a larger algorithm or transformation in linear algebra or matrix computations.
