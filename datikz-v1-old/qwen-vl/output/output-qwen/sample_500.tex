To solve this problem, we need to determine the color pattern based on the given condition that \(N\), \(N+2/3\), and \(N+3+1/3\) should receive the same color. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's express the numbers in a more convenient form:
\[ N = N \]
\[ N + \frac{2}{3} = N + \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ N + 3 + \frac{1}{3} = N + \frac{10}{3} \]

We need to find a common color for these three numbers. To do this, we need to understand the color pattern. Since the problem does not provide specific details about the color pattern, we can assume a simple repeating pattern. A common assumption is that the numbers are colored in a repeating cycle of some length. For simplicity, let's assume the numbers are colored in a repeating cycle of 3 (since we have three numbers here).

If the numbers \(N\), \(N + \frac{2}{3}\), and \(N + \frac{10}{3}\) are all in the same color, then the color pattern must be such that these numbers fall into the same group within the cycle. This implies that the difference between these numbers must be a multiple of the period of the color cycle.

Let's check if the difference between consecutive terms is consistent with a cycle of 3:
\[ \left(N + \frac{2}{3}\right) - N = \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ \left(N + \frac{10}{3}\right) - \left(N + \frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{8}{3} \]
\[ \left(N + \frac{10}{3}\right) - N = \frac{10}{3} \]

For the numbers to be in the same color, the differences must be consistent with the cycle length. If we assume the cycle length is 3, then the differences should be multiples of 3 or fractions that simplify to a multiple of 3 when considering the periodicity. Here, \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{10}{3}\) are both multiples of \(\frac{2}{3}\), which fits the pattern if the cycle length is 3.

Therefore, the numbers \(N\), \(N + \frac{2}{3}\), and \(N + \frac{10}{3}\) will all be in the same color if the color pattern is such that every third number is in the same color. This means that the color of \(N\) is the same as the color of \(N + \frac{2}{3}\) and \(N + \frac{10}{3}\).

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The same color}}
\]
