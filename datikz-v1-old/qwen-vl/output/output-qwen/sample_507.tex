To solve this problem, we need to determine how many squares can fit into a circular grid of radius \( r = 10 \) and width \( s = 1 \), given that each square can extend its corners beyond the circle's boundary as long as it does not go outside the circle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Grid Layout**:
   - Each square in the grid has a side length of 1.
   - The squares are arranged in a circular pattern such that they touch each other along their sides and do not extend beyond the circle's boundary.

2. **Calculating the Diameter of the Circle**:
   - The radius of the circle is \( r = 10 \).
   - Therefore, the diameter of the circle is \( 2r = 20 \).

3. **Determining the Number of Squares Along the Diameter**:
   - Since the squares are arranged in a grid and each square has a side length of 1, the number of squares that can fit along the diameter (both horizontally and vertically) is equal to the diameter of the circle divided by the side length of the square.
   - Thus, the number of squares along the diameter is \( \frac{20}{1} = 20 \).

4. **Arranging Squares in a Circular Pattern**:
   - To arrange these squares in a circular pattern, we need to consider the arrangement in terms of rows and columns.
   - The number of rows and columns will be equal because the squares are arranged symmetrically around the center of the circle.

5. **Calculating the Number of Rows and Columns**:
   - Since there are 20 squares along the diameter, and the squares are arranged in a circular pattern, the number of rows and columns will be the same.
   - Therefore, the number of rows and columns is \( \sqrt{20^2 / 20} = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.47 \).

6. **Adjusting for Integer Values**:
   - Since the number of rows and columns must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number.
   - Hence, the number of rows and columns is 4.

7. **Verifying the Arrangement**:
   - With 4 rows and 4 columns, the total number of squares is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \).
   - This arrangement fits within the circle's diameter of 20 units, as the distance between the centers of adjacent squares is 1 unit, and the total distance from one edge of the circle to the opposite edge is 20 units.

### Final Answer:
The maximum number of squares that can fit into the circular grid with a radius of 10 and a width of 1, arranged in a circular pattern, is \(\boxed{16}\).
