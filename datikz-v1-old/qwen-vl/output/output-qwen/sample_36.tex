This description sounds like it could be referring to a specific type of tree structure known as a "ternary tree." A ternary tree is a tree data structure where each node can have up to three children. In your case, the tree appears to be a balanced ternary tree, which means that every level of the tree is filled completely except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right.

Here's how you might visualize this:

- **Level 0 (Root):** One node.
- **Level 1:** Three nodes (one at each side).
- **Level 2:** Nine nodes (three sets of three nodes on each side).

The tree you described seems to follow this pattern, with a total of 13 nodes (1 + 3 + 9). Each level is filled symmetrically, and the tree is balanced, meaning that no level is more than one level deeper than any other level.

If you're working with such a tree in a programming context, you would need to implement functions to traverse the tree, insert nodes, delete nodes, or perform other operations based on the specific requirements of your application. If you need help with coding or further details about the structure, feel free to ask!
