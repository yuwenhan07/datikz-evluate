The geometric progression formula typically represents a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. The general form of a geometric progression can be expressed as:

\[ a_n = a \cdot r^{(n-1)} \]

where:
- \( a_n \) is the nth term in the sequence,
- \( a \) is the first term in the sequence,
- \( r \) is the common ratio (a constant multiplier),
- \( n \) is the position of the term in the sequence.

In this context, let's break down the formula into "related" and "unrelated" components:

### Related Paths:
1. **First Term (\( a \))**: This is the initial value of the sequence.
2. **Common Ratio (\( r \))**: This is the factor by which each term is multiplied to get the next term.
3. **Exponent (\( n-1 \))**: This indicates how many times the common ratio \( r \) is applied to the first term \( a \).

### Unrelated Paths:
There are no unrelated paths in the geometric progression formula itself because all parts of the formula are directly related to the concept of a geometric sequence. Each component serves a specific purpose in defining the sequence.
