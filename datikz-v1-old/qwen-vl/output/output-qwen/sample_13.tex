The image you've described appears to be a graphical representation of some data, likely related to the chemistry scores of Vietnamese students in 2019. Here's a breakdown of what we can infer from your description:

1. **Graph Type**: The graph is likely a histogram or a box plot (box-and-whisker plot), which are common ways to visualize distributions of numerical data.
   - A histogram shows the frequency distribution of a dataset by dividing the range of values into intervals (bins) and plotting the number of observations that fall into each bin.
   - A box plot provides a graphical summary of the distribution of a dataset, showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

2. **Color Scheme**: 
   - Blue and white are often used for clarity and distinction between different elements of the graph.
   - The red dot could represent a specific value, such as the mean, median, or a significant outlier, depending on the context of the graph.

3. **Red Dot**:
   - If the red dot represents the mean, it would indicate the average chemistry score of the students.
   - If it represents the median, it would show the middle value of the sorted scores, meaning half of the students scored above this value and half below.
   - If it represents an outlier, it might be a score that is significantly higher or lower than the rest of the data points.

4. **Distribution**:
   - The shape of the graph (whether it is symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right) would give insights into the spread and central tendency of the scores.
   - If the graph is symmetric, the mean and median would be approximately equal.
   - If it is skewed to the right, the mean would be greater than the median, indicating a few high scores pulling the average up.
   - If it is skewed to the left, the mean would be less than the median, suggesting a few low scores pulling the average down.

Without the actual image, it's challenging to provide more specific details about the exact distribution or the exact position of the red dot. However, if you were to analyze the graph yourself, you could use statistical software or tools like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or specialized statistical software to calculate the mean, median, and other relevant statistics.

If you have access to the actual image, you could describe the specific features of the graph (e.g., the number of bins, the position of the red dot relative to the bins, etc.), and I could provide more detailed analysis based on those specifics.
