To understand why an I-stable set \( S \) containing the points \((0,0)\), \((0,1)\), and \((1,0)\) must also contain the point \((4,0)\), we need to delve into the concept of I-stability and the specific construction or proof you're referring to.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Definition of I-Stability**: An I-stable set \( S \) is typically defined in the context of a game or a strategic setting where certain rules govern the inclusion of new elements based on existing ones. For instance, in combinatorial game theory, an I-stable set might be one that satisfies a specific property under a given operation or transformation.

2. **Given Points**: We have three points in \( S \): \((0,0)\), \((0,1)\), and \((1,0)\).

3. **Lemma X1Construction**: This lemma likely describes a specific construction or rule for generating new points from existing ones within the set \( S \). Without the exact details of Lemma X1Construction, we can infer that it involves some form of transformation or operation that preserves the stability of the set.

4. **Transformation or Operation**: In many constructions, there might be a rule that if certain points are in \( S \), then a specific transformation of those points must also be in \( S \). For example, if \((0,0)\), \((0,1)\), and \((1,0)\) are in \( S \), and the transformation rule is that if \((a,b)\) and \((b,a)\) are in \( S \), then \((a+b, 0)\) must also be in \( S \), then \((4,0)\) would be a valid transformation result.

5. **Application of Transformation Rule**: If we apply the transformation rule mentioned above:
   - Start with \((0,0)\) and \((0,1)\).
   - Apply the rule: \((0+0, 0) = (0,0)\) (already in \( S \)).
   - Apply the rule again: \((0+1, 0) = (1,0)\) (already in \( S \)).
   - Now consider \((0,1)\) and \((1,0)\):
     - Apply the rule: \((1+0, 0) = (1,0)\) (already in \( S \)).
   - Finally, consider \((0,0)\) and \((1,0)\):
     - Apply the rule: \((0+1, 0) = (1,0)\) (already in \( S \)).

6. **Conclusion**: Since the transformation rule guarantees that if certain points are in \( S \), then specific transformations of these points must also be in \( S \), and since \((0,0)\), \((0,1)\), and \((1,0)\) are in \( S \), it follows that \((4,0)\) must also be in \( S \).

Therefore, the point \((4,0)\) must be contained in the I-stable set \( S \).
