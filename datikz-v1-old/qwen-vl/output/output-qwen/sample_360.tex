It seems like you're referring to a specific algebraic structure, likely in the context of algebraic topology or homology theory, where \(H^*(Q_4)\) denotes the cohomology ring of a space \(Q_4\) with coefficients in some field. The notation \(_\{1\} M_1 = 0\) suggests that there is a specific element \(M_1\) in this cohomology ring and it is annihilated by an operation indexed by 1.

Let's break down the components:

1. **\(H^*(Q_4)\)**: This represents the cohomology ring of the space \(Q_4\). Cohomology is a way to study topological spaces by associating algebraic objects to them, such as groups or rings. In the case of cohomology, we typically work with coefficients in a field, which simplifies many computations.

2. **Relation \(_\{1\} M_1 = 0\)**: Here, \(_\{1\}\) is likely an operation or a differential operator in the cohomology ring. The notation \(M_1\) refers to a specific element in the cohomology ring. The equation \(_\{1\} M_1 = 0\) means that applying the operation \(_\{1\}\) to the element \(M_1\) results in zero. This could be interpreted as \(M_1\) being a zero element for the operation \(_\{1\}\).

### Possible Interpretations

- **Differential**: If \(_\{1\}\) is a differential operator, then \(M_1\) is a cocycle (an element whose image under the differential is zero). This is common in the context of cohomology, where cocycles represent closed forms.
  
- **Multiplication by a Class**: If \(_\{1\}\) is multiplication by a class in the cohomology ring, then \(M_1\) must be a multiple of the class corresponding to the index 1. For example, if \(_\{1\}\) is multiplication by the generator of the first cohomology group, then \(M_1\) would have to be a multiple of that generator.

Without more context about the specific space \(Q_4\) and the nature of the operation \(_\{1\}\), it's difficult to provide a more detailed interpretation. However, the general idea is that \(M_1\) is an element in the cohomology ring that is annihilated by the operation indexed by 1.

If you have more details about the space \(Q_4\) or the operation \(_\{1\}\), please provide them so I can give a more precise answer.
