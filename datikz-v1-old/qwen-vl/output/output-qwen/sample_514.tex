It seems like you're describing an interconnected system where the linear system \( G \) interacts with a nonlinear disturbance. However, your description is somewhat abstract without specific details about the components or their interactions.

To provide more concrete information or analysis, we would need:

1. **The Linear System \( G \)**: A mathematical model that describes the behavior of the linear part of the system. This could be represented by a transfer function, state-space equations, or another form depending on the nature of the system.
   
2. **The Nonlinear Disturbance**: A description of the nonlinear component that affects the system. This could be a function that introduces nonlinearity into the system's dynamics.

3. **The Interactions**: How the linear system \( G \) and the nonlinear disturbance interact. This could involve the disturbance affecting the input to the linear system, the output of the linear system being affected by the disturbance, or both.

4. **The Black and White Picture**: Since you mentioned it as a black and white picture of a white box with a black border, this might be a visual representation of the system. Typically, such a diagram would show the inputs, outputs, and the components of the system (like \( G \) and the disturbance).

If you can provide more details about these aspects, I can help you analyze the system or provide further insights. For example, if you have a mathematical model for \( G \) and the disturbance, we can discuss how they interact and what kind of analysis or control strategies might be appropriate.
