It seems like you're referring to an image that could be interpreted as a mixed graph, which typically consists of both directed (arrows) and undirected (lines) edges connecting nodes (dots). However, the description of it being a "bridge" and having a "geometric pattern" suggests it might also resemble a representation of a bridge's structure, such as a truss or a suspension bridge.

If this image is indeed a depiction of a bridge, it would likely show the structural elements like beams, cables, and supports. If it's a mixed graph, it would show nodes connected by both types of edges.

Since you've mentioned it's up to Step 3, it might be part of a larger process or analysis, perhaps in the context of graph theory or structural engineering. If you have specific questions about the image or need further analysis, feel free to provide more details!
