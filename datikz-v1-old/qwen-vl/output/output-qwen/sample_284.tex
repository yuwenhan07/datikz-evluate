It seems like you've described an image, but there's no image attached to your text. If you're referring to "D_n" as a mathematical or scientific notation, it typically represents a sequence or set where 'n' is an index. However, without more context, it's hard to provide a specific interpretation.

If you have a question related to this notation or if you'd like me to help with something else based on the description of the image, please feel free to ask!
