It seems you're describing a visual representation of mathematical content, possibly from a textbook or an academic paper. Here's a breakdown of what you've described:

- **Encircled Elements**: These could refer to specific elements within the mathematical expressions that are highlighted for emphasis.
- **Same Cycle of \(_0^{-1}_1\)**: This notation might be referring to a concept in group theory where elements are part of the same cycle under a certain operation (like inversion).
- **White Background**: The background of the image is white, which is common for digital documents or slides to ensure readability.
- **Series of Mathematical Equations and Symbols**: The image contains a sequence of mathematical notations and symbols, likely representing a set of equations or a proof.
- **Three Columns of Numbers and Variables**:
  - The first column has a red background.
  - The second column has a white background.
  - The third column has a black background.
- **Red, White, and Black Backgrounds**: These colors are used to differentiate between the columns, which can help in organizing the information visually.
