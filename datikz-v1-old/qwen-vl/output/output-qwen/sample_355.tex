The whiteboard in the image seems to depict a graph that illustrates the relative price development of A and B shares (labeled as "P") in relation to an underlying redeemable asset C. The lines on the graph are labeled with "interest," "invest," and "divest," which likely represent different stages or conditions affecting the share prices.

Here's a breakdown of what each term might signify:

- **Interest**: This could refer to the interest rate or the cost of borrowing money, which might influence the value of the shares.
- **Invest**: This term suggests investment decisions, such as buying or selling shares, which can affect the price.
- **Divest**: This indicates the act of selling assets, which might also impact the share prices.

The points along the line could represent specific time periods or events that have influenced the share prices over time. The red and blue lines might represent the performance of A and B shares respectively, showing how they have developed relative to the underlying asset C.
