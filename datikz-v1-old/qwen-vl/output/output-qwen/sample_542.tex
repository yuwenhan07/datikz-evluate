It seems like you're describing a scenario involving graph theory or a similar mathematical concept where lines (edges) intersect in a network. Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Intersection Number Between Two Red Lines**: This is given as \( n - 12 \). This could refer to the number of times two specific red lines intersect each other.

2. **Intersection Number of Red and Black Lines**: This is given as just one. This means that there is exactly one point where a red line intersects with a black line.

Given these points, let's consider what this might mean in a more concrete context, such as a graph where edges are drawn on a plane and intersections occur at vertices.

### Example Interpretation:
Imagine we have a graph with several red and black edges. If we focus on the red lines, the statement "the intersection number between two red lines is \( n - 12 \)" suggests that if we take any two red lines, they intersect at \( n - 12 \) points. Here, \( n \) could be the total number of red lines or some other relevant parameter depending on the problem's specifics.

The second part, "the intersection number of red and black lines is just one," indicates that there is only one point where a red line intersects with a black line.

### Possible Scenario:
If we assume \( n \) represents the total number of red lines, then the intersection number between two red lines being \( n - 12 \) implies that for any pair of red lines, they intersect at \( n - 12 \) points. This could be a hypothetical situation or a specific condition in a problem.

### Conclusion:
Without additional details about the total number of lines or the structure of the graph, it's challenging to provide a more precise interpretation. However, the key points are:
- There is an intersection number of \( n - 12 \) between any two red lines.
- There is exactly one intersection between a red line and a black line.
