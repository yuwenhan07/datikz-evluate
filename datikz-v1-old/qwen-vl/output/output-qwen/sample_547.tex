The description you provided suggests that the image is a graph showing some form of data distribution among Vietnamese students in 2021, specifically related to their chemistry scores. Here's how we can interpret this:

1. **Color Coding**: 
   - Blue might represent lower scores or a lower range of scores.
   - Red might represent higher scores or a higher range of scores.

2. **Graph Type**:
   - The graph appears to be a line graph, which typically shows trends over time or across different categories.
   - The line on the graph likely represents the average score or a trend line for the chemistry scores.

3. **Data Representation**:
   - The values on the line could indicate the mean, median, or mode of the chemistry scores.
   - The x-axis might represent different groups of students (e.g., by grade level, school, or other demographic factors), while the y-axis would represent the chemistry scores.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - If the line is sloping upwards, it indicates an increasing trend in chemistry scores over time or across different groups.
   - If the line is sloping downwards, it indicates a decreasing trend.

Without the actual image, it's difficult to provide more specific details about the exact values or the exact nature of the data being represented. However, based on your description, it seems like the graph is designed to show the performance or participation levels of Vietnamese students in chemistry in 2021, with a visual distinction between lower and higher scores using blue and red colors respectively.
