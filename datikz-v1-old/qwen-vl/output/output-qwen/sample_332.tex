It seems like you're describing an illustration or a visual aid that includes a whiteboard with mathematical content. Here's a textual summary of what you've described:

The illustration involves a whiteboard that displays several mathematical elements:
- Three distinct equations: one is a tangent function (tan), and the other two are linear functions (y = mx + b) and a logarithmic function (y = ln(x + 1)).
- Graphs corresponding to these equations, showing the tangent line and the two logarithmic curves.
- The whiteboard is organized to clearly present these mathematical concepts.

If you need further assistance or have specific questions about the mathematical content or the illustration, feel free to ask!
