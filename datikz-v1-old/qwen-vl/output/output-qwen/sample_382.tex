To provide a clear understanding of the two representative cases in Operation~op01, we need to define what an "anchor" means in this context and then describe the scenarios for both a 0-anchor and a 1-anchor.

### Definitions:
- **Anchor**: In the context of graph operations, an anchor typically refers to a vertex that plays a specific role in the operation. For simplicity, let's assume that a 0-anchor is a vertex \( v \) such that it has a specific property or relationship with other vertices in the graph, and similarly, a 1-anchor is another type of vertex with a different property or relationship.
- **Edge \(\{v, v'\}\)**: This represents an edge connecting two vertices \( v \) and \( v' \) in the graph.

### Case 1: \( v \) is a 0-anchor
In this case, the vertex \( v \) has a specific property or relationship that makes it a 0-anchor. The green edge \(\{v, v'\}\) connects \( v \) to another vertex \( v' \). The operation might involve modifying the graph based on the properties of \( v \) being a 0-anchor. For example, if \( v \) is a 0-anchor, the operation might involve removing \( v \) from the graph or changing its connections in a specific way.

### Case 2: \( v \) is a 1-anchor
Similarly, in this case, the vertex \( v \) has a different property or relationship that makes it a 1-anchor. The green edge \(\{v, v'\}\) connects \( v \) to another vertex \( v' \). The operation might involve modifying the graph based on the properties of \( v \) being a 1-anchor. For example, if \( v \) is a 1-anchor, the operation might involve adding \( v \) to the graph or changing its connections in a specific way.

### Summary of Cases:
1. **Case 1: \( v \) is a 0-anchor**
   - \( v \) has a specific property or relationship that defines it as a 0-anchor.
   - The green edge \(\{v, v'\}\) connects \( v \) to another vertex \( v' \).
   - The operation modifies the graph based on the properties of \( v \) being a 0-anchor.

2. **Case 2: \( v \) is a 1-anchor**
   - \( v \) has a different property or relationship that defines it as a 1-anchor.
   - The green edge \(\{v, v'\}\) connects \( v \) to another vertex \( v' \).
   - The operation modifies the graph based on the properties of \( v \) being a 1-anchor.

These cases illustrate how the properties of the anchor vertex \( v \) can influence the operation and the role of the green edge in the graph.
