The image you described appears to be a visual representation of a network or system where each triangle represents a separate entity or group, and the dots represent the connections or relationships between these entities. In this case, it seems that there is no direct connection between any two triangles, as all the dots are placed within the boundaries of their respective triangles.

This could be an example of a "not connected" society, where there is no direct communication, interaction, or exchange between different groups or individuals. This could be due to various reasons such as geographical isolation, cultural differences, or political barriers.

In a not connected society, information and resources may not flow freely between different groups, leading to a lack of collaboration, innovation, and progress. It can also result in a lack of understanding and empathy among different groups, which can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings.

However, it's important to note that not all societies are completely disconnected, and even in a not connected society, there may still be indirect connections through other means such as trade, migration, or cultural exchange. Additionally, some societies may have a hierarchical structure where certain groups have more power and influence over others, which can create a sense of separation and disconnection.
