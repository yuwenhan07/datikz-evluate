It seems like you're describing a visual representation of a network involving four nodes, where each node is connected to others through edges that have associated time and delay information. This could be a model used in various fields such as computer networks, telecommunications, or even social networks.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what this might look like:

1. **Nodes**: These represent entities in the network (e.g., computers, people, devices). In your description, there are four nodes.

2. **Edges**: These represent the connections between the nodes. Each edge is decorated with two pieces of information:
   - **Available Time**: This could refer to the time it takes for data to travel from one node to another.
   - **Delay Time**: This could represent additional time delays due to factors like processing time at the nodes or other network-related issues.

3. **Visual Representation**:
   - **White Background**: This is the base color of the image.
   - **Black Circle**: This central element likely represents the network itself or a specific node within the network.
   - **Lines**: These radiate outwards from the central black circle, connecting it to the other nodes. Each line represents an edge in the network.
   - **Numbers**: These numbers are placed around the central black circle and along the lines, indicating the available time and delay times for each connection.

### Example Interpretation

Let's assume the numbers around the central circle and along the lines represent the following:
- **Numbers around the central circle**: These could represent the total available time or some aggregated metric related to the network's performance.
- **Numbers on the lines**: These numbers could indicate the available time for each connection (e.g., "5" could mean 5 seconds) and the delay time (e.g., "2" could mean an additional 2 seconds).

### Possible Use Cases

This type of visualization can be used in various scenarios:
- **Network Performance Analysis**: To understand how different parts of the network perform under varying conditions.
- **Traffic Management**: To optimize traffic flow and reduce delays in communication systems.
- **System Monitoring**: To track the health and efficiency of interconnected systems over time.
