To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure and the connections between the vertices of the 5-gon and the 10-gon. Let's denote the vertices of the 5-gon as \(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5\) and the vertices of the 10-gon as \(B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5, B_6, B_7, B_8, B_9, B_{10}\). The connections are such that each vertex of the 5-gon is connected to the opposite vertex of the 10-gon. This means:

- \(A_1\) is connected to \(B_5\)
- \(A_2\) is connected to \(B_6\)
- \(A_3\) is connected to \(B_7\)
- \(A_4\) is connected to \(B_8\)
- \(A_5\) is connected to \(B_9\)

We need to determine which two vertices are not correctly connected. Since there are only five vertices in the 5-gon and ten vertices in the 10-gon, and each vertex of the 5-gon is supposed to be connected to one specific vertex of the 10-gon, it implies that all connections should be correct if no two vertices are incorrectly connected.

However, the problem states that two vertices are not correctly connected. This means that out of the five connections, two of them are incorrect. To find which two vertices are not correctly connected, we can consider the possible pairs of incorrect connections. The possible pairs of incorrect connections are:

- \((A_1, B_5)\) and \((A_2, B_6)\)
- \((A_1, B_5)\) and \((A_3, B_7)\)
- \((A_1, B_5)\) and \((A_4, B_8)\)
- \((A_1, B_5)\) and \((A_5, B_9)\)
- \((A_2, B_6)\) and \((A_3, B_7)\)
- \((A_2, B_6)\) and \((A_4, B_8)\)
- \((A_2, B_6)\) and \((A_5, B_9)\)
- \((A_3, B_7)\) and \((A_4, B_8)\)
- \((A_3, B_7)\) and \((A_5, B_9)\)
- \((A_4, B_8)\) and \((A_5, B_9)\)

Without additional information, we cannot definitively determine which two connections are incorrect. However, the problem implies that there is a unique pair of incorrect connections among the five connections. Therefore, the answer is:

\(\boxed{(A_1, B_5) \text{ and } (A_2, B_6)}\)

This is just one possible pair, and any other pair would also be a valid solution based on the problem statement.
