The description you've provided seems to be describing a visual pattern that could be interpreted as a sequence of images forming a grid or a series of squares. However, it's not entirely clear what you mean by "extra critically non-line graphs." If you're referring to a specific type of graph or diagram, please provide more details so I can assist you better.

If you're looking for a mathematical or graphical representation that is non-linear, one example could be a fractal, such as the Sierpinski triangle or the Mandelbrot set. These are complex geometric shapes that are generated through iterative processes and do not follow a simple linear relationship between their components.

For your described pattern, if we were to interpret it mathematically, it might be seen as a sequence of numbers (L, L, 1, 2) arranged in a grid-like structure. This could be part of a larger sequence or pattern, but without additional context, it's hard to determine its significance.

If you have any specific questions about this pattern or need further assistance with a different type of graph or sequence, feel free to ask!
