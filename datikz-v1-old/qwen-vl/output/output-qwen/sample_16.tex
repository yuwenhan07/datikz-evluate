To illustrate Case 1 as described in your statement, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Definitions and Notations:
- \( V(Q^) \): The set of all vertices in the graph \( Q^ \).
- \( V_1 \): A subset of vertices in \( V(Q^) \).
- \( P_1 \), \( P_u \), and \( P_2 \): Paths in the graph.
- \( S\langle V_1 \rangle \): An out-branching rooted at some vertex in \( V_1 \).
- \( x_1 \) and \( y_1 \): Specific vertices in the graph.

### Case 1 Explanation:
The case involves two main parts: one for collecting vertices using \( y_1 \) and another for collecting vertices using \( x_1 \).

#### Part 1: Using \( y_1 \)
- **Vertices to be collected**: Those in \( V(Q^) - V_1 \) (vertices not in \( V_1 \)).
- **Conditions**: These vertices should not be covered by the paths \( P_1 \), \( P_u \), or the out-branching of \( S\langle V_1 \rangle \).

**Illustration**:
1. Identify all vertices in \( V(Q^) - V_1 \).
2. Check if these vertices are part of any path \( P_1 \) or \( P_u \).
3. Check if they are part of the out-branching of \( S\langle V_1 \rangle \).
4. Collect the vertices that do not satisfy either condition.

#### Part 2: Using \( x_1 \)
- **Vertices to be collected**: Those in \( V(Q^) - V_+1 \) (vertices not in \( V_+1 \)).
- **Conditions**: These vertices should not be covered by the paths \( P_2 \) or \( P_y_ \) or the out-branching of \( S\langle V_+1 \rangle \).

**Illustration**:
1. Identify all vertices in \( V(Q^) - V_+1 \).
2. Check if these vertices are part of any path \( P_2 \) or \( P_y_ \).
3. Check if they are part of the out-branching of \( S\langle V_+1 \rangle \).
4. Collect the vertices that do not satisfy either condition.

### Summary:
- **Using \( y_1 \)**: Collects vertices from \( V(Q^) - V_1 \) that are not covered by \( P_1 \), \( P_u \), or the out-branching of \( S\langle V_1 \rangle \).
- **Using \( x_1 \)**: Collects vertices from \( V(Q^) - V_+1 \) that are not covered by \( P_2 \), \( P_y_ \), or the out-branching of \( S\langle V_+1 \rangle \).

This process ensures that we are isolating specific subsets of vertices based on their coverage by certain paths and structures within the graph.
