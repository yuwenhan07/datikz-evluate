It seems like you're describing a specific section of a structure, possibly a game board or a puzzle setup, but the description is quite abstract without an actual image to reference. However, I can provide some general guidance based on your description.

If we consider "sub-counterwall G'" as part of a larger structure, it might be referring to a section of a game board or a puzzle where "G'" could denote a specific group or area within that structure. The term "X-free bricks" suggests that there are no bricks marked with an 'X' in this particular section.

Given that the image is described as a black and white picture of a triangle, let's break down what this might mean:

1. **Triangle Shape**: The structure appears to be triangular in shape.
2. **Top Row**: The top row of the triangle is being discussed, which typically means the first row from the bottom.
3. **X-Free Bricks**: This indicates that the bricks in the top row do not have an 'X' mark on them.

Without a visual reference, it's challenging to provide more specific details. If you have a diagram or a clearer image, please share it, and I can offer more precise assistance. If you're working on a puzzle or game, understanding the rules or context would also help in providing a more accurate interpretation.
