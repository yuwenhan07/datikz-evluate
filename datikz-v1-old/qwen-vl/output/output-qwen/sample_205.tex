To illustrate the cases (1) and (2) of Theorem \ref{DispersiveTheorem} for the given conditions, we need to understand the regions in the plane defined by the variables \( \frac{1}{p} \) and \( \frac{1}{q} \).

### Case (1)
Case (1) corresponds to the union of the two gray regions with the exception of the line segment defined by:
\[ \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{n-\sigma}{n} \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq \frac{1}{p} \leq 1. \]

This can be visualized as follows:

1. **Gray Regions**: The gray regions are the areas in the plane where the inequality holds for some specific range of \( \frac{1}{p} \). These regions are typically bounded by lines or curves that depend on the parameters \( n \), \( \sigma \), and \( \gamma \).
2. **Exclusion Line Segment**: The line segment is defined by the equation \( \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{n-\sigma}{n} \). This line segment runs from \( \left(0, \infty\right) \) to \( \left(1, \frac{1}{p} - \frac{n-\sigma}{n}\right) \) as \( \frac{1}{p} \) varies from 0 to 1.

### Case (2)
Case (2) corresponds to the line segment:
\[ \left\{ \left( \frac{n-2\gamma}{2n}, \frac{1}{q} \right) : 0 \leq \frac{1}{q} < \frac{2\sigma - 2\gamma - n}{2n} \right\}. \]

This can be visualized as follows:

1. **Line Segment**: The line segment is defined by the points where \( \frac{1}{p} = \frac{n-2\gamma}{2n} \) and \( \frac{1}{q} \) ranges from 0 to \( \frac{2\sigma - 2\gamma - n}{2n} \). This line segment is horizontal at \( \frac{1}{p} = \frac{n-2\gamma}{2n} \) and extends vertically from \( \frac{1}{q} = 0 \) to \( \frac{1}{q} = \frac{2\sigma - 2\gamma - n}{2n} \).

### Summary
- **Case (1)**: The union of the two gray regions minus the line segment defined by \( \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{n-\sigma}{n} \) for \( 0 \leq \frac{1}{p} \leq 1 \).
- **Case (2)**: The line segment defined by \( \frac{1}{p} = \frac{n-2\gamma}{2n} \) and \( 0 \leq \frac{1}{q} < \frac{2\sigma - 2\gamma - n}{2n} \).

These regions and segments are typically plotted in a graph with \( \frac{1}{p} \) on the x-axis and \( \frac{1}{q} \) on the y-axis, showing the allowed and excluded regions based on the given inequalities and conditions.
