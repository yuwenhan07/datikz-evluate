It seems like you're describing an image that might be related to a diagram or a visual representation of nodes in a network or system. However, there's no actual image provided for me to align a circle and a rectangle with the same starting y-axis. If you could provide more details or clarify what you're trying to achieve, I'd be happy to help further!
