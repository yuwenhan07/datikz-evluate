It seems like you're describing a type of diagram that could be a Sudoku puzzle or a similar logic puzzle where numbers are placed in a grid according to certain rules. However, without seeing the actual image, I can provide a general description of what such a diagram might look like based on your description.

For a 9x9 grid (n=9), if j=1 and p=6, this suggests we might be dealing with a specific type of Sudoku variant or a related puzzle. Here's a general outline of how such a diagram might appear:

1. **Grid Structure**: A 9x9 grid, which is divided into 9 smaller 3x3 grids.
2. **Numbers**: Each cell in the grid contains a number from 1 to 9.
3. **Constraints**: The numbers must follow the standard Sudoku rules:
   - Each row must contain the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once.
   - Each column must contain the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once.
   - Each of the 9 3x3 sub-grids must contain the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once.

If the numbers are connected by lines forming a pattern, it might suggest additional constraints or clues that are not part of the standard Sudoku rules but rather part of a more complex puzzle. For instance, the lines could indicate relationships between numbers that need to be satisfied, such as "X" marks indicating pairs of numbers that cannot be in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.

Without the actual image, it's hard to provide a precise example. If you have the image, please share it, and I can help you analyze it further!
