The object you've described sounds like it could be a hexagonal trapezohedron, which is a type of polyhedron. A hexagonal trapezohedron is a symmetrical solid with 12 faces, each of which is an isosceles trapezoid. It's often used in various fields such as architecture, design, and even in some forms of art.

Given the description of the object being blue and green, and having a sharp, angular shape, it seems to match the geometric properties of a hexagonal trapezohedron. The color mix might be due to lighting effects or the way the object is rendered in the image.

If this is indeed a hexagonal trapezohedron, it would have 12 faces, 30 edges, and 14 vertices. It's a fascinating shape that can be found in nature, such as in certain crystal formations, and also in man-made structures for its aesthetic and structural properties.

If you're looking to create or understand more about this object, you might want to explore further into geometric shapes and their applications in different contexts. If it's part of a specific project or artwork, the creator might provide additional details or context about the design choices and inspiration behind the piece.
