It seems like you're dealing with some complex mathematical concepts, particularly related to distances and paths in a structured space or graph. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Definitions and Notations

1. **^-Distance**: This appears to be a custom distance measure that might be defined as \( \frac{N}{2^k + 1} \). It could be a specific type of metric used in certain contexts, such as in algorithms for network routing or in theoretical computer science.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The ^-distance between points \(a\) and \(b\) is given as \( \frac{N}{2^k + 1} \).
   - The ^-distance between points \(c\) and \(d\) is given as \( \frac{2^{-k}}{5tN^{2/3}} \).

3. **Inequality**:
   - The condition \( |a-b|_{^-} < |c-d|_{^-} \) suggests that the distance between \(a\) and \(b\) is less than the distance between \(c\) and \(d\).

4. **Paths and Avoidance**:
   - There is a statement about the existence of a directed path that avoids a specific set of points. Specifically, it mentions avoiding a point \(L^{(s+t_i=0^{k-1}2^{-i}/5)}N^{2/3}_lN/2^k+1\).

### Analysis

Given the inequality \( |a-b|_{^-} < |c-d|_{^-} \), we know that the distance between \(a\) and \(b\) is smaller than the distance between \(c\) and \(d\). This implies that the path from \(a\) to \(b\) is shorter than the path from \(c\) to \(d\).

The statement about the directed path going through certain points and avoiding others suggests a constraint on the path. The avoidance of a specific point \(L^{(s+t_i=0^{k-1}2^{-i}/5)}N^{2/3}_lN/2^k+1\) indicates that the path must not pass through this particular location.

### Conclusion

If the ^-distance between \(a\) and \(b\) is indeed less than the ^-distance between \(c\) and \(d\), then it logically follows that any path from \(a\) to \(b\) will be shorter than any path from \(c\) to \(d\). Therefore, if the path from \(a\) to \(b\) exists and avoids the specified point, it is consistent with the given conditions.

Thus, the statement about the non-existence of a directed path that goes through certain points while avoiding another point is consistent with the provided inequalities and conditions.

In summary, the given conditions and constraints are self-consistent, and the path described in the problem can indeed exist under the given ^-distance measures and inequalities.
