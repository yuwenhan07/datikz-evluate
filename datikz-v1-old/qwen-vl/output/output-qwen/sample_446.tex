It seems you're describing an illustration that uses arrows to visually represent the equivalence between two equations (Eqn.~(eqn:p1) and Eqn.~(eqn:p2)). Here's a textual description of how such an illustration might look:

**Illustration Description:**

The illustration features a white background with a variety of green and black arrows. These arrows vary in length and thickness, adding depth and complexity to the design. The arrows are scattered across the canvas, creating a sense of randomness and dynamism.

Key elements:
- **Arrows:** Green and black arrows are used to symbolize the relationship between Eqn.~(eqn:p1) and Eqn.~(eqn:p2).
  - Some arrows point from Eqn.~(eqn:p1) to Eqn.~(eqn:p2), indicating that Eqn.~(eqn:p1) implies or leads to Eqn.~(eqn:p2).
  - Other arrows point from Eqn.~(eqn:p2) to Eqn.~(eqn:p1), suggesting that Eqn.~(eqn:p2) also implies or leads to Eqn.~(eqn:p1).
- **Network-like Pattern:** The arrangement of the arrows forms a network-like structure, emphasizing the interconnectedness and equivalence between the two equations.
- **Visual Complexity:** The varying sizes and thicknesses of the arrows add visual interest and help guide the viewerâ€™s eye through the illustration, highlighting the relationships between the equations.
