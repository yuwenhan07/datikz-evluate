It seems you're describing a visual representation of a mathematical concept known as the "corona" of a graph, specifically the corona \(K_3 \vee K_1\). In graph theory, the corona of two graphs \(G\) and \(H\) is formed by taking one copy of \(G\) and \(|G|\) copies of \(H\), and then joining each vertex of the \(i\)-th copy of \(H\) to the \(i\)-th vertex of \(G\).

For the specific case of \(K_3 \vee K_1\):
- \(K_3\) is a complete graph with 3 vertices (a triangle).
- \(K_1\) is a trivial graph with just one vertex.

The corona \(K_3 \vee K_1\) would thus consist of:
- One copy of \(K_3\) (the triangle).
- Three copies of \(K_1\) (three isolated vertices).
- Each of these three isolated vertices is connected to one of the vertices of the triangle.

In terms of the visual description provided, it sounds like the image might be illustrating this structure. The dots could represent the vertices of the graph, with the connections between them forming the edges. The arrangement of the dots and their spacing would reflect the connectivity pattern described above: three dots forming a triangle, and three additional dots connected to the vertices of the triangle.

If the image indeed depicts such a structure, it would show a triangular shape with three additional points connected to the vertices of the triangle, representing the corona \(K_3 \vee K_1\). The curve-like appearance might be due to artistic interpretation or a simplification for visualization purposes, but the core structure should align with the mathematical definition of the corona graph.
