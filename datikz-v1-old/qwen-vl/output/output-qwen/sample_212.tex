It sounds like you're describing a simple illustration that could be interpreted as a stylized representation of a face or a character. Here's a breakdown of what you've described:

- **Two-cup body**: This might refer to a figure that is composed of two cups, possibly suggesting a shape where the top part resembles a head and the bottom part resembles a body.
- **Wavy line**: This could represent hair or some kind of flowing element.
- **Circle in the middle**: This is likely the "eye" you mentioned, which is a central feature of the drawing.
- **Square frame around the circle**: This gives the impression of an eye, as the square frame could be seen as the eyelid or the outline of the eye.

Given these elements, the drawing could be interpreted as a simple, abstract representation of a face or a character with a unique design. If you have any specific questions about this interpretation or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
