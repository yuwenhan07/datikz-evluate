It seems like you're describing an image that contains a mathematical diagram or symbol, specifically a white and black triangle with arrows and other symbols inside it. This type of diagram could be part of a presentation, a document, or a slide related to mathematics or theoretical computer science.

If this diagram is related to the gadget \(T_{\text{enc}}\) encoding initial values in terms of two-sided partial expectations, it might be illustrating concepts from probability theory or information theory. Two-sided partial expectations refer to the expectation of a random variable given both past and future information, which can be crucial in understanding complex systems where information is not fully known at any point in time.

Without more specific details about the symbols and arrows, it's challenging to provide a precise interpretation. However, if you have a specific question about the diagram or the concept of \(T_{\text{enc}}\), feel free to ask!
