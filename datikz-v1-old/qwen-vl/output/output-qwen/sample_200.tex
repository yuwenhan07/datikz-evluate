To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the 1-skeleton and how the given factorization rules affect it. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the 1-skeleton**: The 1-skeleton is a graph where each vertex represents an object and each edge represents a morphism between objects. The factorization rules \( c_2 b_1 e_1 a_2 \) and \( e_2 a_1 c_1 b_2 \) provide specific ways to factorize certain paths in this graph.

2. **Understand the factorization rules**: The rules \( c_2 b_1 e_1 a_2 \) and \( e_2 a_1 c_1 b_2 \) suggest that there are specific paths in the graph that can be factored into these sequences. These rules imply that certain edges can be removed or combined under specific conditions.

3. **Reduction and color sets**: The text mentions that the word \( w \) is fully reducible with a color set consisting of red (dashed) and blue (dotted) edges. This means that we can reduce the graph by removing edges according to the rules provided, but only if the color set is appropriate. If a smaller color set is chosen, the first condition of Definition red might not be satisfied, meaning that the reduction process might not work as expected.

4. **Observe the issue**: The text points out that if we try to remove the edge \( b_1 \), it will only remove one edge of the commuting square \( c_2 b_1 e_1 a_2 \). This means that the resulting 1-skeleton will not correspond to a 2-graph because the structure of the commuting square is not preserved. A 2-graph requires that all commuting squares are preserved, which is not the case here.

5. **Conclusion**: The key point is that the choice of color set is crucial for the reduction process to work correctly. If the color set is too small, the reduction process will fail to preserve the structure of the 2-graph. Therefore, the correct answer is that the 1-skeleton cannot be reduced in a way that preserves the structure of the 2-graph if a smaller color set is used.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The 1-skeleton cannot be reduced in a way that preserves the structure of the 2-graph if a smaller color set is used.}}
\]
