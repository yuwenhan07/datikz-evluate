The statement you've made touches on some important aspects of de Sitter space, which is a spacetime model that describes an expanding universe with positive cosmological constant. Let's break down the key points:

1. **de Sitter Space-Time**: This is a maximally symmetric spacetime with a positive cosmological constant \(\Lambda\). It is often used as a model for the early universe or the universe at large scales.

2. **Spatial Sphere**: In de Sitter space, the spatial sections (slices of constant time) are spheres of radius \(R(t)\), where \(R(t)\) is the scale factor of the universe. The radius \(R(t)\) grows exponentially with time due to the positive cosmological constant.

3. **Poles of the Spatial Sphere**: The poles of the spatial sphere correspond to the points where the spatial curvature is most pronounced. These points are located at the "north" and "south" poles of the spatial section.

4. **Time Translation Invariance**: The de Sitter metric has a time translation symmetry, meaning that the metric remains unchanged under a shift in time. This symmetry allows us to map any point in the spacetime to another point by simply shifting the time coordinate.

5. **Global Equal Time Slice**: By using the time translation invariance, we can map two points on the poles of the spatial sphere to a global equal time slice. Specifically, if we have two points at the north pole (\(t_x = -t\)) and the south pole (\(t_y = t\)), we can map them to a global equal time slice where both points have the same time coordinate \(t = 0\).

6. **Geodesics Between Poles**: Geodesics are the shortest paths between two points in spacetime. In de Sitter space, there are no real geodesics connecting the north pole (\(t_x = -t\)) and the south pole (\(t_y = t\)) unless \(t = 0\). This is because the exponential expansion of the universe causes the distance between these points to increase with time, and the only way to connect them would be through a path that crosses the singularity at \(t = 0\), which is not a real geodesic.

In summary, the de Sitter time-translation invariance allows us to map the poles of the spatial sphere to a global equal time slice, but there are no real geodesics connecting these poles unless the time coordinate is zero. This reflects the fact that the universe is expanding, and the distance between these points increases over time.
