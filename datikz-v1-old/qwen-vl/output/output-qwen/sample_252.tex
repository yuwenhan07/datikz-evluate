It looks like you're describing some kind of transformation or mapping process involving three different components: `left`, `middle`, and `right`. Let's break down the notation to understand what each part means:

1. **`T in defT, = id(left)`**: This suggests that `T` is defined as the identity function on the `left` component. The identity function maps every element in its domain to itself.

2. **`T'' in defT'', = id(middle)`**: Similarly, `T''` is defined as the identity function on the `middle` component. Again, this means that `T''` maps every element in the `middle` component to itself.

3. **`T'' in defT'', = (15)(right)`**: Here, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a typo. If `T''` is supposed to be defined as `(15)(right)`, it implies that `T''` is a function that maps elements from the `right` component to another set of elements, possibly through a transformation or mapping labeled as `(15)`. However, without more context, it's hard to determine exactly what `(15)` represents. It could be a specific operation, a label for a transformation, or something else entirely.

### Summary:
- `T` is an identity function on the `left` component.
- `T''` is an identity function on the `middle` component.
- `T''` is defined as some transformation or mapping labeled as `(15)` applied to the `right` component.

If you have more context or if these definitions are part of a larger system, please provide additional details so I can offer a more accurate interpretation or further assistance.
