It seems like you're referring to an automaton, which is a mathematical model used to describe the behavior of systems that change over time. In this case, "A(A^_2)" might be the name or identifier of the automaton.

The network you described could represent the state transitions of the automaton. Each node in the network represents a state, and the arrows between the nodes represent the transitions from one state to another based on certain inputs or conditions.

The equations accompanying the network could provide additional information about the behavior of the automaton, such as the rules for transitioning between states or the conditions under which certain actions occur.

If you have more specific questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask!
