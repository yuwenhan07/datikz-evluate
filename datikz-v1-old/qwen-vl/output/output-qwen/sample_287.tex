The image you've described is a bar chart or a line graph that visualizes the publication years of papers that reuse an existing benchmark set within the context of the DaCapo, MediaBench, PolyBench, NAS, PARSEC, and SPEC corpus. However, since the specific data points for each year are not provided in your description, I cannot directly extract the exact publication years of all 157 corpus papers that reuse an existing benchmark set.

To determine the publication years of these papers, you would need to:

1. **Identify the relevant papers**: These are the papers that reuse one of the benchmark sets mentioned (DaCapo, MediaBench, PolyBench, NAS, PARSEC, SPEC).
2. **Extract the publication years**: From the metadata of these papers, you can find the publication years.
3. **Count the papers**: Ensure that you have counted exactly 157 papers.

If you provide the specific data points or a dataset containing the publication years of these papers, I could help you analyze and summarize them further. Alternatively, if you have access to the graph itself, you might be able to extract the data by analyzing the y-axis values for each corresponding x-axis year.

If you need assistance with extracting data from the graph, please share the graph or the data points, and I'll guide you through the process.
