It seems like you're describing an image that contains a mathematical or geometric concept represented in a visual form, specifically using a tree-like structure with labels and formulas. This type of representation is often used in mathematics to illustrate relationships between different concepts or to solve problems.

In this case, the tree could be a visual aid for understanding a specific mathematical theorem, proof, or concept. The labels on the branches might represent variables, constants, or steps in a process, while the formulas could be equations or expressions that describe the relationships between these elements.

Without more specific details about the formulas and labels, it's difficult to provide a precise interpretation of what the image represents. However, if you can share more information about the formulas and labels, I may be able to help you better understand the meaning behind the image.
