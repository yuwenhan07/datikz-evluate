It seems like you're describing an image that involves a geometric structure, specifically a cube, which has been rotated to show different perspectives. The mention of "pairing" and "C_8" suggests some form of mathematical or combinatorial analysis might be involved.

In mathematics, \(C_8\) typically refers to the cyclic group of order 8, which could imply that there are 8 possible rotations of the cube (since a cube can be rotated in 24 ways, but only 8 of these are distinct up to symmetry).

If we consider the cube's faces and edges, each face of the cube can be paired with another face in a specific way depending on the rotation. For example, if we label the faces of the cube as A, B, C, D, E, F, then a pairing could be (A, B), (C, D), (E, F). In this case, since the cube has 6 faces, we would need 3 pairs to cover all faces.

Given that the image shows a black and white picture of a cube with its sides consisting of various smaller squares and triangles, it's likely that the image is illustrating one of these pairings or rotations. If the three pairings in red represent specific rotations or pairings of the cube's faces, they could be highlighting certain symmetries or patterns within the cube.

Without seeing the actual image, it's difficult to provide more specific details. However, if you describe the image further or provide more context about what you're trying to analyze, I can offer more targeted assistance.
