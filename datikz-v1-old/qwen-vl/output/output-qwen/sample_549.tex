It seems like you're describing a visual representation or diagram that includes a non-linearity gadget with a specific structure. Let's break down the elements:

1. **Triangle**: This is labeled as representing the unary gadget `[y, 1]`. In the context of logic gates or computational models, this could represent a simple input-output relationship where `y` is the output and `1` is the input.

2. **White Arrow**: The arrow points from the triangle to a green dot. This suggests a directional flow or transformation from the input (represented by the triangle) to the output (represented by the green dot).

3. **Green Dot**: This likely represents the output of the operation defined by the triangle. Given the context of a unary gadget, it might be the result of applying some function to the input `1`.

4. **Blank White Space**: The rest of the scene is entirely white, indicating that there are no other elements or connections in this particular view.

### Interpretation:
- The white arrow pointing from the triangle to the green dot indicates a transformation or computation. Since the triangle represents a unary gadget `[y, 1]`, it implies that the input `1` is being transformed into an output `y`.
  
### Summary:
The image depicts a unary gadget `[y, 1]` where the input `1` is transformed into the output `y`. The white arrow visually represents this transformation, and the green dot signifies the resulting output. The blank white space around these elements suggests that this is a standalone operation without additional inputs or outputs shown in this particular view.
