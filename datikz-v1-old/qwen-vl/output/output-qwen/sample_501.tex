The statement you've provided seems to be describing a pattern observed in the behavior of certain physical systems, particularly those involving the cosmological constant, as they evolve across different dimensions. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Complex Plane**: The complex plane is a two-dimensional space where the horizontal axis represents the real part (Re) and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part (Im). This is often used in physics to represent complex numbers.

2. **Deformation Contours**: These contours likely refer to paths or shapes that emerge when analyzing the behavior of a system in the complex plane. These contours can change shape depending on various parameters, such as the dimensionality of the system and the sign of the cosmological constant.

3. **Cosmological Constant (\(\Lambda\))**: In physics, especially in cosmology, the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) is a term added to Einstein's field equations of general relativity. It represents a form of energy density that is uniformly distributed throughout space and time. The sign of \(\Lambda\) (\(\Lambda > 0\), \(\Lambda < 0\), or \(\Lambda = 0\)) affects the geometry of spacetime and the dynamics of the universe.

4. **Rotation in the Complex Plane**: The statement mentions that for \(\Lambda > 0\), the contour rotates counterclockwise by \(\pi/2\) with each increment in dimension. This suggests a periodicity in the behavior of these contours as the dimensionality of the system increases.

### Interpretation

Given the context, it appears that the deformation contours in the complex plane are influenced by the cosmological constant and the dimensionality of the system. When \(\Lambda > 0\), the contours rotate counterclockwise by \(90^\circ\) (or \(\pi/2\) radians) with each additional dimension. This rotation could be indicative of how the system's properties change as we move from lower to higher dimensions under the influence of a positive cosmological constant.

### Example

To illustrate this, consider a simple example:
- If we start with a 1D system, the contour might be a straight line.
- As we increase to a 2D system, the contour could rotate \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise.
- Moving to a 3D system, the contour would rotate another \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise, and so on.

This pattern suggests a systematic change in the shape of the contours as the dimensionality increases, driven by the positive cosmological constant.

### Conclusion

The statement describes a specific pattern in the behavior of deformation contours in the complex plane, which is influenced by the dimensionality of the system and the sign of the cosmological constant. For a positive cosmological constant, the contours rotate counterclockwise by \(90^\circ\) with each increment in dimension. This kind of behavior is not uncommon in theoretical physics, where complex systems exhibit periodic or oscillatory patterns as parameters vary.
