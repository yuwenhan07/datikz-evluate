It looks like you're referring to an observation or a set of observations related to triangles, specifically labeled as "obs_path_triangles_1". The obstruction set \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}\) is defined as containing three elements: \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_1\), \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_2\), and \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_3\). This could be part of a larger mathematical or computational framework where these elements represent specific conditions or constraints that need to be considered.

If you have more context or if you need further assistance with this notation or concept, please provide additional details. For instance, what is the context in which this obstruction set is being used? Are there any specific properties or rules associated with \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_1\), \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_2\), and \(\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_3\)?
