  "prompt": "\\footnotesize{Sticky snapping out Brownian motion is a Feller process on $\\ka$ copies of $[0,\\infty]$ (here $\\ka =3$), which on the $i$th copy behaves like a one-dimensional sticky Brownian motion with stickiness coefficient $a_i/b_i$. After spending enough time at $(0,i)$ the process jumps to one of the points $(0,j), j\\not =i$ to continue its motion on the corresponding copy of $[0,\\infty]$, and so on. Times between jumps are governed by parameters $c_i$.}",
