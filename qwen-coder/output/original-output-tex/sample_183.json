  "prompt": "Various paths. The dotted line is the boundary of $W$. All the dashed lines represent paths, and the one at the bottom is $R$. The thick dashed lines are the paths we will use to construct a pair of $S-T$ paths with distance three. The paths $Q_i$ have been drawn as though their interiors are disjoint from $W$, but they might not be; each is a path of a supercomponent, but the supercomponent might penetrate into $W$ a short distance, via joints. In particular the ends of each $Q_i$ have been drawn exactly on the surface, but they might be slightly deeper in $W$, or just outside of $W$.",
