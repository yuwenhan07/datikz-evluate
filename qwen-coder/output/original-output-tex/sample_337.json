Below is a simple TikZ LaTeX code to represent the given components (Sink, Reserve Station, and Supply Stations) in a structured manner:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm]\n\n    % Nodes for Sink, Reserve Station, and Supply Stations\n    \\node (sink) at (0,0) [draw, circle, fill=blue!20] {Sink};\n    \\node (reserve_station) at (2,-1) [draw, rectangle, fill=green!20] {Reserve Station};\n    \\node (supply_substation_1) at (4,-2) [draw, circle, fill=red!20] {Supply Substation 1};\n    \\node (supply_substation_2) at (6,-3) [draw, circle, fill=orange!20] {Supply Substation 2};\n\n    % Drawing arrows between nodes\n    \\draw[->] (sink) -- node[midway, above] {Supply} (reserve_station);\n    \\draw[->] (reserve_station) -- node[midway, above] {Supply} (supply_substation_1);\n    \\draw[->] (reserve_station) -- node[midway, above] {Supply} (supply_substation_2);\n\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis code creates a basic diagram with nodes representing the Sink, Reserve Station, and two Supply Stations. Arrows are drawn from the Sink to the Reserve Station, and from the Reserve Station to each of the Supply Stations, indicating a supply relationship.\n\nFeel free to adjust the positions, colors, or add more details as needed!",
