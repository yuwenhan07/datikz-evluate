  "prompt": "Visualization of different candidate proposal techniques. The local one does achieve relatively good acceptance rates while not exploring the state space. Uniform updating tries to explore the state space but struggles with acceptance since the proposed state has most likely high energy. However, the discussed quantum proposal routine samples states that are far away in the state space while having comparable energy, thus, also leading to high acceptance rates.",
  "response": "Certainly!
