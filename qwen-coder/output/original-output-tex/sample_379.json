Let's denote these vertices as \\( v_1, v_2, \\) and \\( v_3 \\).\n\n2. **Induced Subgraph**: An induced subgraph is formed by selecting a subset of vertices from the original graph and including all edges that connect these selected vertices.\n\n3. **Given Set of Vertices**: We are given the set \\( \\{v_1, v_3\\} \\). This means we will include only these two vertices in our induced subgraph.\n\n4. **Edges in the Induced Subgraph**: Since we are only considering the vertices \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_3 \\), we need to check which edges exist between these vertices in the original \\( P_3 \\). In \\( P_3 \\), there is an edge between \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\), and another edge between \\( v_2 \\) and \\( v_3 \\).
