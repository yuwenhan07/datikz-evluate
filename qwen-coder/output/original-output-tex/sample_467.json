We'll assume that the domains and codomains are finite-dimensional spaces for simplicity.\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass[tikz,border=5mm]{standalone}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]\n\n% Axes for Graph of Σ+\n\\draw[->] (0,-2) -- (0,2) node[above] {$y$};\n\\draw[->] (-2,0) -- (2,0) node[right] {$x$};\n\n% Points for Graph of Σ+\n\\foreach \\x in {-1.8,-1.6,...,1.8} {\n    \\draw (\\x, {0.5*\\x^2}) circle (2pt",
