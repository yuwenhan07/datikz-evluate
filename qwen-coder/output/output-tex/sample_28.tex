To create an axis with fractional units in TikZ, you can use the `xtick` option to specify the tick positions and labels. Here's an example code that draws an axis with fractional units:
```
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (-1,0) -- (5,0) node[right] {$x$};
    \foreach \x in {0, 1/20, 2/20, ..., 5} {
        \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1);
        \node at (\x, -0.2) {\pgfmathparse{\x*20}\pgfmathresult};
    }
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
In this code, we first draw the x-axis from -1 to 5. Then, we loop through each tick position from 0 to 5 with a step size of 1/20. For each tick position, we draw a small vertical line and label it with its corresponding fractional value.
Note that we use the `\pgfmathparse` command to convert the fractional value to an integer by multiplying it by 20. This is because we want to display the fractional values as integers (e.g., 3/20 should be displayed as 6).
