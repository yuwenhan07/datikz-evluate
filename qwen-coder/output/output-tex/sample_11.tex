To establish the \( N \)-extendibility of the thermal-noise channel, we need to demonstrate that the channel can be extended to an \( N \)-mode channel by amplifying and splitting the initial state into \( N \) modes using a beam splitter. Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve this:

1. **Define the Initial State**: Start with an initial quantum state \(\rho\) in a single mode.

2. **Amplify the State**: Use a linear optical amplifier to amplify the initial state. This transforms the state from \(\rho\) to \(A\rho A^\dagger\), where \(A\) is the amplitude gain operator.

3. **Split the Amplified State**: Use a beam splitter to split the amplified state into \(N\) modes. The beam splitter operation can be represented as:
   \[
   \mathcal{B} = \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 \\
   0 & e^{i\phi}
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   For \(N\) modes, the beam splitter can be generalized to:
   \[
   \mathcal{B}_N = \begin{pmatrix}
   I_{(N-1)/2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{e^{i\phi/2}}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
   0 & \frac{e^{i\phi/2}}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 & I_{(N-1)/2}
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   where \(I_{(N-1)/2}\) is the identity matrix of size \((N-1)/2\).

4. **Combine Operations**: Apply the beam splitter to the amplified state. The resulting state after applying the beam splitter will be:
   \[
   \mathcal{B}_N(A\rho A^\dagger)\mathcal{B}_N^\dagger
   \]

5. **Verify Extendibility**: To verify that the channel is \(N\)-extendible, you need to show that the output state has the desired properties for an \(N\)-mode channel. This typically involves checking the entanglement structure, noise characteristics, and other relevant physical properties.
