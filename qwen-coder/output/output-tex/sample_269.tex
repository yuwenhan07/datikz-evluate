To create a TikZ diagram representing the semilattice of idempotents of \( FI_1 \), we need to understand that \( FI_1 \) is the category whose objects are finite sets with one element and morphisms are injective functions between these sets. The idempotents in this context correspond to certain matrices.

Given \( u = (-a, 3, b) \in FI_1 \), we can represent it as a matrix:
\[
u = \begin{pmatrix}
-a & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & b
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The idempotents in \( FI_1 \) are those matrices that commute with \( u \). These matrices are of the form:
\[
e = \begin{pmatrix}
e_{11} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & e_{22} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & e_{33}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
where \( e_{ii} \) are either 0 or 1. This is because any non-zero entry off the diagonal would not commute with \( u \).

To visualize this in a TikZ diagram, we can place the red dots at positions corresponding to the possible values of \( e_{11}, e_{22}, \) and \( e_{33} \). Here is the TikZ code to generate the diagram:
