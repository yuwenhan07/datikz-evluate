To understand the birational equivalence of $\mathbb{P}(L \oplus \mathbb{C})$ to a weighted projective plane, where $L$ is an orbibundle over an orbisphere, we need to delve into some algebraic geometry concepts.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Orbifolds and Orbibundles**:
   - An orbifold is a generalization of a manifold that allows for singularities.
   - An orbibundle over an orbispace is a vector bundle where the total space has an orbifold structure.

2. **Projective Space**:
   - $\mathbb{P}(L \oplus \mathbb{C})$ is the projectivized bundle associated with the direct sum of the orbibundle $L$ and the trivial line bundle $\mathbb{C}$.

3. **Weighted Projective Plane**:
   - A weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(a:b:c)$ is a generalization of the standard projective plane where the coordinates $(x:y:z)$ satisfy the relation $ax^a by^b cz^c = 0$.

4. **Birational Equivalence**:
   - Two varieties are birationally equivalent if there exist rational maps between them that are inverses on a dense open subset.

### Key Insight:

For an orbibundle $L$ over an orbisphere, the projectivized bundle $\mathbb{P}(L \oplus \mathbb{C})$ can be birationally equivalent to a weighted projective plane under certain conditions. This equivalence often arises in the context of resolutions of singularities or compactifications of moduli spaces.

### Example:

Consider a simple example where $L$ is a trivial line bundle over an orbisphere. In this case, $\mathbb{P}(L \oplus \mathbb{C})$ is simply $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is already a weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(1:1:1)$.

### TikZ Code:

Here's a basic TikZ code snippet to illustrate the concept of a weighted projective plane (though it won't show the full complexity of birational equivalence):
