To generate the TikZ LaTeX code for the induced \( P_3 \) in \( \mathcal{C}_3(P_3) \) generated by \( (\{v_1, v_3\}, C) \), where \( C = \{c_1, c_2, c_3\} \), we need to understand the structure of the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding \( P_3 \)**: A path graph \( P_3 \) consists of three vertices connected in a linear sequence. Let's denote these vertices as \( v_1, v_2, \) and \( v_3 \).

2. **Induced Subgraph**: An induced subgraph is formed by selecting a subset of vertices from the original graph and including all edges that connect these selected vertices.

3. **Given Set of Vertices**: We are given the set \( \{v_1, v_3\} \). This means we will include only these two vertices in our induced subgraph.

4. **Edges in the Induced Subgraph**: Since we are only considering the vertices \( v_1 \) and \( v_3 \), we need to check which edges exist between these vertices in the original \( P_3 \). In \( P_3 \), there is an edge between \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \), and another edge between \( v_2 \) and \( v_3 \). However, since we are only considering \( v_1 \) and \( v_3 \), the edge between \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) is not included in the induced subgraph.

5. **Conclusion**: The induced subgraph generated by \( \{v_1, v_3\} \) in \( P_3 \) is simply a single edge connecting \( v_1 \) and \( v_3 \).

Now, let's write the TikZ LaTeX code for this induced subgraph:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
    % Draw nodes
    \node (v1) at (-1,0) [circle, draw] {v1};
    \node (v2) at (0,0) [circle, draw] {};
    \node (v3) at
