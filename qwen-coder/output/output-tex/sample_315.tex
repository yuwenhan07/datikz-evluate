To generate a TikZ LaTeX diagram that visualizes one of the cobounding maps \( X \to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) on the Thue–Morse shift, we need to understand the properties of the Thue–Morse sequence and how it relates to the cobounding map.

The Thue–Morse sequence is defined by the morphism:
\[ \varphi: \{a, b\}^* \to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}, \quad \varphi(a) = 1, \quad \varphi(b) = 0 \]

The sequence starts as follows:
\[ a, b, ab, bab, abbab, babba, abbabbaba, \ldots \]

Each term in the sequence is obtained by applying the morphism iteratively. For example:
- \( \varphi(a) = 1 \)
- \( \varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \)
- \( \varphi(bab) = \varphi(b)\varphi(a)\varphi(b) = 0 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \)
- \( \varphi(abbab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)\varphi(b)\varphi(a)\varphi(b) = 1 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \)

We are interested in a cobounding map that is constant on cylinders of length 7. A cylinder of length \( n \) consists of all words of length \( n \) that share the same prefix up to some point.

Let's consider a specific cobounding map \( f: X \to \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \). We can define \( f \) such that it takes a value depending on the first few symbols of the word. Since the sequence is periodic with period 7, we can use this property to define our map.

Here is a TikZ LaTeX code to visualize this:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    % Define the nodes
    \foreach \i in {0,...,6} {
        \node (n\i) at (\i
