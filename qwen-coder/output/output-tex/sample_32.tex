Here's some sample TikZ LaTeX code that could generate an image similar to the one you described:
```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
  % Large triangle on the left side of the whiteboard
  \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (4,0) -- (2,3) -- cycle;
  % Smaller triangles scattered across the rest of the surface
  \draw[thick] (1,-1) -- (3,-1) -- (2,-3) -- cycle;
  \draw[thick] (5,1) -- (7,1) -- (6,3) -- cycle;
  \draw[thick] (9,-2) -- (11,-2) -- (10,-4) -- cycle;
  % Letters and numbers
