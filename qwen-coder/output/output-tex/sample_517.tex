I'm sorry, but I am unable to generate images or diagrams as I am a text-based AI language model. However, I can provide you with some information about creating a tree diagram in TikZ LaTeX.
To create a tree diagram in TikZ LaTeX, you can use the `tikz` package and the `forest` library. Here's an example code that creates a simple binary tree:
```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{forest}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[level distance=2cm,
  level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
  level 2/.style={sibling distance=2cm}]
  \node {A}
    child {node {B}}
    child {node {C}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
This code creates a binary tree with three nodes labeled A, B, and C. You can customize the tree by adding more levels and nodes, changing the style of the nodes, and adding labels and formulas to the branches. The `forest` library provides many options for customizing the appearance of trees in TikZ LaTeX.
