To create a TikZ diagram representing an automaton for the given properties in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), we need to understand the structure of the automata required to recognize the languages \( L(\varphi) \) and \( L(\neg \varphi) \).

The property \(\varphi = F_{[0,10]}a \land G_{[0,20]}\neg b\) can be broken down into two parts:
- \(F_{[0,10]}a\): There exists a point within the next 10 time units where \(a\) holds.
- \(G_{[0,20]}\neg b\): For all points within the next 20 time units, \(b\) does not hold.

Similarly, the negation \(\neg \varphi\) will be:
- \(\neg F_{[0,10]}a\): It is never true that there exists a point within the next 10 time units where \(a\) holds.
- \(\neg G_{[0,20]}\neg b\): It is not always true that for all points within the next 20 time units, \(b\) does not hold.

### Automaton for \(L(\varphi)\)

The automaton for \(L(\varphi)\) will have states that track whether \(a\) has been seen within the last 10 steps and whether \(b\) has been seen within the last 20 steps.
