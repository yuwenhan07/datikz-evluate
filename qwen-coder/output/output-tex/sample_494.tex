Certainly! Below is an example of how you can create a TikZ diagram to visualize the rolling mean of loss per batch for 10 peers within the same shard, with each peer represented by a different color.

```latex
\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.16}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        width=12cm,
        height=8cm,
        title={Rolling Mean Loss per Batch for 10 Peers},
        xlabel={Batch Number},
        ylabel={Loss},
        legend pos=north west,
        ymin=0,
        ymax=1,
        xtick=data,
        grid=major,
        cycle list name=exotic
    ]
        % Example data points for 10 peers
        \addplot coordinates {(1,0.4)(2,0.3)(3,0.45)(4,0.5)(5,0.4)
                            (6,0.55)(7,0.6)(8,0.5)(9,0.45)(10,0.5)};
        \label{peer1}
        
        \addplot coordinates {(1,0.35)(2,0.3)(3,0.4)(4,0.45)(5,0.5)
                            (6,0.55)(7,0.6)(8,0.5)(9,0.45)(10,0.5)};

                            (6,0.55)(7,0.6)(8,0.5)(9,0.45)(10,0.5)};
        \label{peer3}
