To construct a matching in \(\Mat_{9,3}^{>2}(1)\) step by step using TikZ, we need to understand the structure of the matrix and the rules for forming a matching. The notation \(\Mat_{9,3}^{>2}(1)\) suggests a 9x3 matrix where each entry is either 0 or 1, and there are more than two 1's in at least one row.

Let's start with an example matrix:
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

We will form a matching step by step, ensuring that no two edges share a vertex and that each edge is represented by a line connecting corresponding rows and columns.

### Step-by-Step Construction

1. **Select the first available edge:**
   - Choose the edge between row 1 and column 1.
   - This edge connects the non-zero entries in row 1 (column 1 and column 3).

2. **Update the matrix:**
   - Set the selected entries to 0:
     \[
     A = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & 0 & 0 \\
     1 & 1 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 1 \\
     1 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 1 \\
     1 & 1 & 1 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 \\
     1 & 0 & 1 \\
     0 & 0 & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]

3. **Select the next available edge:**
   - Choose the edge between row 4 and column 2.
   - This edge connects the non-zero entries in row 4 (column 2).

4. **Update the matrix:**
   - Set the selected entry to 0:
     \[
     A = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & 0 & 0 \\
     1 & 1 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 1 \\
     0
