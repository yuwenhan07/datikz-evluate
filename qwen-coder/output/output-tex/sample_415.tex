To illustrate the maximal case where \( u \) and \( v \) do not have a common neighbor and \( G \) has a triangle, we can construct a graph that meets these criteria. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Graph Structure**:
   - We need a triangle in the graph.
   - Vertices \( u \) and \( v \) should not share any neighbors other than those within the triangle.

2. **Vertices and Edges**:
   - Let the vertices of the triangle be \( a, b, \) and \( c \).
   - \( u \) and \( v \) should only connect to \( a, b, \) or \( c \).

Given these constraints, let's construct the graph and then color it using 3 colors.

### Step-by-Step Construction

1. **Triangle**: Create a triangle with vertices \( a, b, \) and \( c \). Connect \( a \) to \( b \), \( b \) to \( c \), and \( c \) to \( a \).
2. **Vertices \( u \) and \( v \)**: Add two additional vertices \( u \) and \( v \). Connect \( u \) to \( a \) and \( v \) to \( b \).

This ensures that \( u \) and \( v \) do not share any neighbors outside of the triangle, and the triangle remains intact.

### TikZ Code

Here is the TikZ code to draw this graph:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]

% Draw the triangle
\node[circle, draw] (a) at (0,0) {a};
\node[circle, draw] (b) at (2,0) {b};
\node[circle, draw] (c) at (1,-1.732) {c};

\draw (a) -- (b);
\draw (b) -- (c);
\draw (c) -- (a);

% Draw vertices u and v
\node[circle, draw] (u) at (-2,-1.732) {u};
\node[circle, draw] (v) at (4,-1.732) {v};

% Connect u to a and v to b
\draw (
