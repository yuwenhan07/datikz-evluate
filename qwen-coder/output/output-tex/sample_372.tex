To represent the induced noncausal dependence in a conditional graph given \( S = s \) based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) \( DM \), we need to highlight the causes of the variable \( S \) being conditioned on and the relevant causal links. This involves identifying the collider fan and how it changes when conditioning.

Let's assume that \( S \) has two direct parents, \( A \) and \( B \), and there are additional variables \( C \) and \( D \) that are descendants of both \( A \) and \( B \). When we condition on \( S = s \), the collider fan around \( S \) can be represented as follows:

1. **Original DAG**: 
   ```
   A -- C -- E
   |         |
   v         v
   B -- D -- F
       |
       v
       S
   ```

2. **Conditional Graph given \( S = s \)**:
   - Mark the causes of \( S \): \( A \) and \( B \).
   - Highlight the relevant causal links: \( A \to C \), \( A \to D \), \( B \to C \), and \( B \to D \).

3. **Collider Fan**:
   - The collider fan around \( S \) consists of the paths \( A \to C \to D \) and \( B \to C \to D \).

Here is the TikZ LaTeX code to draw this:

```latex
\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric, arrows.meta}

\tikzset{
    block/.style = {rectangle, rounded corners, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm,text centered, draw=black, fill=blue!30},
    line/.style = {draw, thick, ->, >=stealth},
    pin style/.style = {pin edge={thick,->}}
}
