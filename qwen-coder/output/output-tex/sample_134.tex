To create a gentle Motzkin path from \((-r, r)\) to \((2n - s, s)\) using TikZ in LaTeX, we need to understand the properties of a Motzkin path. A Motzkin path is a path that starts at \((0, 0)\), ends at \((2n, 0)\), and consists of steps that go up (\(U\)), down (\(D\)), or horizontally right (\(H\)). The path must not go below the x-axis.

Given:
- \( n = 13 \)
- \( r = 4 \)
- \( s = 2 \)

The starting point is \((-r, r) = (-4, 4)\).
The ending point is \((2n - s, s) = (26 - 2, 2) = (24, 2)\).

We will use a combination of horizontal steps (\(H\)), up steps (\(U\)), and down steps (\(D\)) to construct the path. Since the path must be gentle, it means that the number of up steps should be equal to the number of down steps plus one (or vice versa).

Here's the TikZ code to draw the gentle Motzkin path:
