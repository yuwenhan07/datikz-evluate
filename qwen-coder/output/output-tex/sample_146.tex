To create a TikZ diagram that visualizes the given distances and conditions, we need to carefully define the coordinates and paths according to the provided information. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can achieve this:

1. **Define the Points**: Based on the distances given, we need to place points \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) at appropriate positions.
2. **Draw Paths**: We need to draw the directed paths as described and ensure they avoid certain segments.

Here's the TikZ code to generate the diagram:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]

% Define the points
\coordinate (a) at (-2, 2);
\coordinate (b) at (2, 2);
\coordinate (c) at (-2, -2);
\coordinate (d) at (2, -2);

% Draw the points
\filldraw[black] (a) circle (2pt) node[above left] {a};
\filldraw[black] (b) circle (2pt) node[above right] {b};
\filldraw[black] (c) circle (2pt) node[below left] {c};
\filldraw[black] (d) circle (2pt) node[below right] {d};

% Draw the paths
\draw[->,gray] (a) -- (b); % Directed path from a to b
\draw[->,gray] (c) -- (d); % Directed path from c to d

% Draw the avoided segments
\draw[dashed,red] (a) -- (c); % Avoided segment between a and c
\draw[dashed,red] (b) -- (d); % Avoided segment between b and d

% Add labels for distances
\node at ($(a)!0.5!(b)$) [above] {$N/2^k + 1$};
\node at ($(c)!0.5!(d)$) [below] {$2^{-k}/5tN^2/3$};

% Add labels for conditions
\node at (0, 3) [above] {If $|a-b| < |c-d|$, then...};
\node at (0, -3) [below] {...there would not exist a
