To create a TikZ diagram representing the SIRV compartmental model for COVID-19 disease dynamics, we need to visually represent the five compartments: Susceptible ($S$), Exposed ($E$), Quarantined ($U$), Recovered ($R$), and Vaccinated ($V$). Additionally, we can include arrows to show the flow between these compartments.

Here's a sample TikZ code that you can use:

```latex
\documentclass[tikz,border=3mm]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric,arrows.meta}

\tikzset{
    node style/.style={rectangle, draw=black, thick, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm},
    arrow style/.style={->, >=Stealth', shorten <=2pt, shorten >=2pt}
}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
    % Nodes
    \node[node style] (S) at (0,4) {Susceptible};
    \node[node style] (E) at (0,2) {Exposed};
    \node[node style] (U) at (-3,0) {Quarantined};
    \node[node style] (R) at (3,0) {Recovered};
    \node[node style] (V1) at (0,-2) {Vaccinated (1st dose)};
    \node[node style] (V2) at (0,-4) {Vaccinated (2nd dose)};
    \node[node style] (V3) at (0,-6) {Vaccinated (3rd dose)};

    % Arrows
    \draw[arrow style] (S) -- node[midway, above] {$\beta$} (E);
    \draw[arrow style] (E) -- node[midway, above] {$\delta$} (R);
    \draw[arrow style] (S) -- node[midway, right] {$\alpha_1$} (V1);
    \draw[arrow style] (V1) -- node[midway, right] {$\alpha_2$} (V2);
    \draw[arrow style] (V2) -- node[midway, right] {$\alpha_3$} (V3);
    \draw[arrow style] (V1) -- node[midway, left] {$\phi
