To generate a TikZ LaTeX diagram for a 2-cube induced in \(\mathcal{C}_3(P_3)\) by the given generator and color assignments, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Generator and Color Assignments**: The generator is \((\{v_0, v_1\}, \{c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10}, c_{11}\})\) where \(v_0\) and \(v_1\) are vertices, and \(c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10}, c_{11}\) are edges colored according to the given assignments.

2. **Construct the Cube**: A 2-cube (or a cube graph) has 8 vertices and 12 edges. We need to place the vertices and edges in a way that reflects the given coloring.

3. **TikZ Code Generation**: Use TikZ to draw the cube and label the edges according to the given colors.

Here's the TikZ code to achieve this:

```latex
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
    % Define the coordinates of the vertices
    \coordinate (v000) at (0,0,0);
    \coordinate (v001) at (1,0,0);
    \coordinate (v010) at (0,1,0);
    \coordinate (v011) at (1,1,0);
    \coordinate (v100) at (0,0,1);
    \coordinate (v101) at (1,0,1);
    \coordinate (v110) at (0,1,1);
    \coordinate (v111) at (1,1,1);

    % Draw the edges
    \draw[thick] (v000) -- (v001) node[midway,below] {$c_{00}$};
    \draw[thick] (v000) -- (v010) node[midway,left] {$c_{01}$};
    \draw[thick] (v000) -- (v100) node[midway,below left] {$c_{10
