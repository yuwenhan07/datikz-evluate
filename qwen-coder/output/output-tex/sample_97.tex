To create a TikZ LaTeX diagram for the monoid \( M = \langle a, b \mid ba = aa \rangle \) with its upho lattice and core \( M_2 \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Monoid Structure**: The monoid \( M \) is defined by the generators \( a \) and \( b \) with the relation \( ba = aa \).

2. **Identify the Upho Lattice**: An upho lattice (upper half-order) is a partially ordered set where every pair of elements has a unique least upper bound.

3. **Determine the Core \( M_2 \)**: The core of a monoid is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of the monoid. For this specific monoid, the core \( M_2 \) can be determined by analyzing the structure of the monoid.

4. **Construct the Diagram**:
   - Draw nodes representing elements of the monoid.
   - Connect nodes with edges to represent the partial order.
   - Highlight the core \( M_2 \) in a distinct manner.

Here is the TikZ LaTeX code to generate the desired diagram:

```latex
\documentclass[tikz,border=5]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric, arrows.meta}

\tikzset{
  element/.style={circle, draw, fill=blue!20, inner sep=5pt},
  core/.style={element, fill=red!20}
}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm]

% Nodes
\node[element] (e1) at (0,0) {e};
\node[element] (a) at (-2,-2) {a};
\node[element] (b) at (2,-2) {b};
\node[element] (ab) at (0,-4) {ab};
\node[core] (a2) at (-2,-6) {a^2};
\node[core] (b2) at (2,-6) {b^2};

% Edges
