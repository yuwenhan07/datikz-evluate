To generate a TikZ diagram for the given complex \(\CFK_{\F[U,V]/UV}(S^3,Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\) that contains the intersection point \(d\) with \(A(d)=\tau(Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\), and \(d+h\) generating \(\HFhat(S^3)\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Complex**: The complex \(\CFK_{\F[U,V]/UV}(S^3,Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\) is a Floer homology complex associated with the link complement in \(S^3\) of the torus knot \(T_{2,3}\).

2. **Intersection Point \(d\)**: The point \(d\) is an intersection point in this complex, and its Alexander polynomial \(A(d)\) equals the tau invariant \(\tau(Q^{0,3}_0(T_{2,3}))\).

3. **Generating \(\HFhat(S^3)\)**: The point \(d+h\) generates the hat version of Heegaard Floer homology \(\HFhat(S^3)\).

Given these points, we can create a simplified TikZ diagram to represent this structure. Here is a possible representation:
