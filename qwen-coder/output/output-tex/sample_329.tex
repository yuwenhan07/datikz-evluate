Certainly! Let's consider a square \( ABCD \) with side length 1, positioned in the coordinate plane such that:
- \( A = (0, 0) \)
- \( B = (1, 0) \)
- \( C = (1, 1) \)
- \( D = (0, 1) \)

We will place four points \( X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4 \) on the edges of this square. For simplicity, let's place them at the midpoints of each edge:
- \( X_1 \) is at the midpoint of \( AB \), so \( X_1 = \left( \frac{1}{2}, 0 \right) \)
- \( X_2 \) is at the midpoint of \( BC \), so \( X_2 = \left( 1, \frac{1}{2} \right) \)
- \( X_3 \) is at the midpoint of \( CD \), so \( X_3 = \left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right) \)
- \( X_4 \) is at the midpoint of \( DA \), so \( X_4 = \left( 0, \frac{1}{2} \right) \)

The counting measure \( \mu = \mu_X \) assigns to each point \( X_i \) a mass of 1. Therefore, the total mass assigned by \( \mu \) is 4.

Here is the TikZ LaTeX code to draw this setup:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    % Draw the square
    \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (1,0) node[midway,below] {$A$};
    \draw[thick] (1,0) -- (1,1) node[midway,right] {$B$};
    \draw[thick] (1,1) -- (0,1) node[midway,above] {$C$};
    \draw[thick] (0,1) -- (0,0) node[midway,left] {$D$};

    % Draw the points
    \filldraw[black] (0.5,0) circle (2pt) node[below] {$X_1
