To generate four search trees on \( K_4 \) and their images through the permutation \(\pi\) on \(\textnormal{SPK}_{2,2}\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define \( K_4 \)**: The complete graph \( K_4 \) has 4 vertices, which we can label as \( A, B, C, D \).

2. **Define the Permutation \(\pi\)**: We need to define a permutation \(\pi\) on the set \(\{A, B, C, D\}\). For simplicity, let's use the permutation \(\pi = (A \ B)(C \ D)\).

3. **Generate Search Trees on \( K_4 \)**: We will create four different search trees on \( K_4 \).

4. **Compute the Image of Each Tree under \(\pi\)**: Apply the permutation \(\pi\) to each vertex in the search tree.

5. **Draw the Original and Transformed Trees**: Use TikZ to draw both the original and transformed trees side by side for comparison.

Here is the TikZ LaTeX code to achieve this:

```latex
\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{trees}

\tikzset{
    mynode/.style={circle,draw,fill=blue!20,minimum size=6mm},
    myedge/.style={thick,-stealth}
}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[level distance=1.5cm]
    % Original Tree 1
    \node[mynode] (A1) at (0,0) {A};
    \node[mynode] (B1) at (-1,-1) {B};
    \node[mynode] (C1) at (1,-1) {C};
    \node[mynode] (D1) at (0,-2) {D};
    
    \path[myedge] (A1) -- (B1);
    \path[myedge] (A1) -- (C1);
    \path[myedge] (A1) -- (D1);
