Certainly! Below is a TikZ LaTeX code to generate a figure showing the symmetric replacement rule that produces the "Laakso diamond" space. This code will illustrate two steps of the replacement process.

```latex
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric}

\tikzset{
    diamond/.style={draw, shape=diamond, aspect=2, inner sep=1pt},
    line/.style={thick}
}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
    % Step 0: Initial Square
    \node[diamond] (A) at (0,0) {A};
    \node[diamond] (B) at (2,0) {B};
    \node[diamond] (C) at (2,-2) {C};
    \node[diamond] (D) at (0,-2) {D};

    % Connect nodes with lines
    \draw[line] (A) -- (B);
    \draw[line] (B) -- (C);
    \draw[line] (C) -- (D);
    \draw[line] (D) -- (A);

    % Labeling
    \node[above left] at (A.north west) {0};
    \node[above right] at (B.north east) {1};
    \node[below right] at (C.south east) {2};
    \node[below left] at (D.south west) {3};

    % Step 1: First Replacement
    \node[diamond] (A1) at (-1,1) {A};
    \node[diamond] (B1) at (3,1) {B};
    \node[diamond] (C1) at (3,-1) {C};
    \node[diamond] (D1) at (-1,-1) {D};

    % Connect nodes with lines
    \draw[line] (A1) -- (B1);
    \draw[line] (B1) -- (C1);
    \draw[line] (C1) -- (D1);
    \draw[line] (D1) -- (A1);

    % Draw lines from step 0 to step 1
    \draw[line] (A) -- (A1);
    \draw[line] (B) -- (B1
