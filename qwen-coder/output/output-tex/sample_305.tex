Here's some TikZ code that you can use to create a similar diagram:
```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm]
\node (eq1) at (0,0) {$a + bi$};
\node (eq2) at (4,0) {$a - bi$};
\node (eq3) at (0,-2) {$-a + bi$};
\node (eq4) at (4,-2) {$-a - bi$};
\draw[->] (eq1.south) -- (eq3.north);
\draw[->] (eq2.south) -- (eq4.north);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{document}
```
This code creates a simple diagram with four nodes representing the equations, and arrows connecting them to show the complex conjugate and opposite braiding relationships. You can customize the code further to add more details or modify the appearance of the diagram as needed.
