To generate a TikZ LaTeX diagram for the graphs \(\operatorname{Graph}(\Sigma_+), \operatorname{Graph}(c + D^+[u_c])\), and \(\operatorname{Graph}(c + \nabla^+ u_c)\) at cohomology class \(c = 0\) in the pendulum case, we need to understand the geometric structures involved. Let's break down each graph:

1. **Graph of \(\Sigma_+\)**:
   - \(\Sigma_+\) is typically a positive operator or a function that maps elements from one space to another.
   - At \(c = 0\), the graph of \(\Sigma_+\) can be visualized as a set of points \((x, \Sigma_+(x))\) where \(x\) is an element of some domain.

2. **Graph of \(c + D^+[u_c]\)**:
   - \(D^+[u_c]\) is likely a differential operator applied to a function \(u_c\).
   - At \(c = 0\), this graph represents the set of points \((x, c + D^+[u_c](x))\).

3. **Graph of \(c + \nabla^+ u_c\)**:
   - \(\nabla^+ u_c\) is likely a gradient operator applied to a function \(u_c\).
   - At \(c = 0\), this graph represents the set of points \((x, c + \nabla^+ u_c(x))\).

Given these interpretations, let's create a simple TikZ diagram to illustrate these concepts. We'll assume that the domains and codomains are finite-dimensional spaces for simplicity.
