To create a TikZ LaTeX diagram that represents the cobounding map modulo \( H = \langle (1\ 2) \rangle \) on the shift of Example \ref{eg:unimodular} for the morphism \(\varphi : \{a, b, c\}^* \to S_3\) with \(\varphi(a) = \varphi(c) = (1\ 2\ 3)\) and \(\varphi(b) = (1\ 2)\), we need to carefully represent the structure of the shift space and the action of the cobounding map.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating this diagram:

1. **Define the Shift Space**: We will represent the shift space as a sequence of states, where each state corresponds to a word in \(\{a, b, c\}^*\).

2. **Action of the Morphism**: Define how the morphism \(\varphi\) maps words to elements of \(S_3\).

3. **Cylinder Structure**: Represent the cylinder structure by showing how states transition over time.

4. **Modulo \(H\)**: Since \(H = \langle (1\ 2) \rangle\), we need to reduce the actions modulo this subgroup.

5. **Constant on Cylinders of Length 4**: Ensure that the cobounding map is constant on cylinders of length 4.

Below is the TikZ code to achieve this:

```latex
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{matrix, arrows.meta}

\begin{document}

\tikzset{
    state/.style={circle, draw=black, fill=white, inner sep=2pt},
    arrow/.style={->, thick, >=Stealth[length=0.2cm]}
}

\begin{tikzpicture}
    % States
    \node[state] (s0) at (0,0) {$\emptyset$};
    \node[state] (s1) at (1.5,0) {$a$};
    \node[state] (s2) at (3,0) {$b$};
    \node[state] (s3) at (4.5,0) {$c$};

    % Cylinder of length 4
    \foreach \i in {0,...,3} {
        \node[state] (s0\i) at (\i,-1)
