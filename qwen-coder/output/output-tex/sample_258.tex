To generate a TikZ LaTeX diagram that represents the maximal support and the Newton polytope of a degree 6 polynomial with a zero of multiplicity 4 at \((0,0)\), we need to understand the following concepts:

1. **Maximal Support**: This is the set of all exponents \((i, j)\) such that the coefficient of \(x^i y^j\) in the polynomial is non-zero.
2. **Newton Polytope**: This is the convex hull of the points corresponding to the exponents in the maximal support.

Given that the polynomial has a zero of multiplicity 4 at \((0,0)\), it must have terms up to degree 4 in both \(x\) and \(y\). However, since the polynomial is of degree 6, there will be additional terms of degree 5 or 6.

Let's assume the polynomial has the form:
\[ P(x, y) = x^4 + ax^3 y + bx^2 y^2 + cy x^3 + dy^3 + ex^2 y + fxy^2 + gy^2 + hx^4 y + ix^3 y^2 + jx^2 y^3 + ky x^4 y + ly^4 \]

For simplicity, let's consider a specific example where the polynomial is:
\[ P(x, y) = x^4 + xy^3 + y^4 \]

### Maximal Support
The maximal support for this polynomial is:
\[ \{(4,0), (1,3), (0,4)\} \]

### Newton Polytope
The Newton polytope is the convex hull of these points:
- Point 1: \((4,0)\)
- Point 2: \((1,3)\)
- Point 3: \((0,4)\)

### TikZ Code
Here is the TikZ code to draw the Newton polytope and the maximal support:

```latex
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
    % Draw axes
    \draw[->] (-1,0) -- (5,0) node[right] {$x$};
    \draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,5) node[above] {$y$};

    % Points of the Newton polytope
