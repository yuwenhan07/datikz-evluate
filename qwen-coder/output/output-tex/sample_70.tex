To create an illustration of the contour $\Gamma_\lambda$ defined in equation \cref{eq:contour}, we need to understand that this contour encloses the region $D_\lambda$ which is specified in assumption \cref{assu:Filter}. Additionally, the dashed interval $[0,\kappa^2]$ contains the spectra of both $T$ and $T_X$.

Here's how you can generate the TikZ LaTeX code for this illustration:

```latex
\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
    % Draw the real axis
    \draw[-Stealth] (-1,0) -- (4,0) node[right] {$\Re$};
    
    % Draw the imaginary axis
    \draw[-Stealth] (0,-1) -- (0,2) node[above] {$\Im$};
    
    % Draw the contour Gamma_lambda
    \draw[dashed, thick] (0,0) to[out=-90,in=90] (1.5,0.75)
                         to[out=-90,in=90] (3,0)
                         to[out=-90,in=90] (3,-0.75)
                         to[out=-90,in=90] cycle;
    \node at (1.5,0.75) [circle, fill=black, inner sep=1pt] {};
    \node at (3,-0.75) [circle, fill=black, inner sep=1pt] {};
    \node at (1.5,-0.75) [circle, fill=white, inner sep=1pt] {};
    \node at (3,0.75) [circle, fill=white, inner sep=1pt] {};
    \node at (2,0) [below] {$\Gamma_\lambda$};
    
    % Draw the dashed interval [0, kappa^2]
    \draw[dashed, thick] (0,0) -- (2,0);
    \node at (1,0) [below] {$[0, \kappa^2]$};
    
    % Label the points on the real axis
    \foreach \x in {0, 1.5, 3}
