<think>Got it, let's try to understand the problem. The question mentions an obstruction set $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}$ which is a set containing three elements: $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_1$, $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_2$, $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_3$. The label is "obs_path_triangles_1", so maybe this is related to some obstruction sets in a path or triangle context, possibly in a mathematical or topological setting. 

First, I need to recall what an obstruction set might be. In algebraic topology, obstruction theory deals with obstructions to extending maps or solving equations, often using cohomology. An obstruction set could be a collection of sets that prevent certain constructions, like a path not being extendable, or a triangle not being closed. 

Given that it's labeled with "triangles", maybe each $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_i$ is an obstruction related to a triangle, perhaps in a graph or a space where triangles are being considered. The superscript (1) might indicate a first obstruction, or a first level, and the subscript 1,2,3 could correspond to different triangles or different types of obstructions. 

Without more context, it's a bit hard, but the key points are that the obstruction set is a collection of three sets, each labeled with (1) and a subscript. The problem might be asking for a description or properties of these sets, but since the user just provided the definition, maybe the task is to state what the obstruction set is, perhaps explaining that it's a set containing three sub-obstruction sets, each possibly representing an obstruction for a different triangle or path component. 

Wait, the original question is just stating the definition: "The obstruction set $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}=\big\{\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_1,\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_2,\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_3\big\}$." Maybe the user wants to know what this means, or perhaps to elaborate on each element. But since the question is presented as a statement with a label, maybe the task is to recognize that it's a set of three obstruction sets, each possibly being a subset or a specific set related to the problem at hand, like in a triangulation or path problem. 

Alternatively, if this is from a specific textbook or context where obstruction sets are defined for triangles, each $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_i$ might be the set of points or conditions that obstruct the existence of a path or a triangle, for the i-th triangle. But without more information, it's hard to say exactly, but the main point is that the obstruction set is a collection of three sets, each labeled with (1) and a number. 

So, summarizing, the obstruction set $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}$ is defined as a set containing three elements: $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_1$, $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_2$, $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_3$. Each of these could be individual obstruction sets related to different aspects of the problem, possibly triangles or paths, as indicated by the label "obs_path_triangles_1". The key is that it's a set of three sets, each being an obstruction set for the first level (indicated by the superscript (1)) and the subscripts 1,2,3 might index different triangles or different types of obstructions.</think><answer>The obstruction set $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}$ is defined as a collection containing three distinct sub-obstruction sets, denoted $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_1$, $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_2$, and $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_3$. This structure suggests a partitioning of obstructions related to triangles or paths, as indicated by the label "obs_path_triangles_1". Each $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_i$ likely represents an obstruction set for a specific triangle or path component at the first level (denoted by the superscript (1)), collectively forming the complete obstruction set $\mathcal{O}^{(1)}$.  

The answer is $<|begin_of_box|>\mathcal{O}^{(1)} = \{\mathcal{O}^{(1)}_1, \mathcal{O}^{(1)}_2, \mathcal{O}^{(1)}_3\}<|end_of_box|>$.</answer>
