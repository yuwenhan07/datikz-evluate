<think>Got it, let's try to figure out the substitution rule for the tile based on the description. The image has white dots on a black background, arranged linearly with positions like x=0,1,2,..., and they become sparser as x increases, forming a continuous line. 

First, substitution rules in tiling often involve replacing each tile with smaller tiles following a specific pattern. Maybe the dots represent a sequence where each step is a substitution. Let's think about the positions: starting at x=0, then x=1, x=2, etc., with increasing spacing. If we consider the positions as a sequence, maybe the substitution is replacing each dot (or group of dots) with a pattern that continues the sequence. 

Wait, the description says "dots become increasingly sparse as x increases, giving the appearance of a continuous line that connects them." So maybe the substitution is similar to the Cantor set, where you remove the middle third, but here it's about spacing. Alternatively, if we model the positions as a sequence, maybe each step replaces each dot with a certain number of dots at positions that follow a pattern. For example, if the original dots are at positions 0,1,2,..., maybe the substitution replaces each dot at position n with dots at positions n and n + 1, but with spacing? Wait, the problem mentions "substitution rule for the tile," so maybe the tile is a unit interval with dots, and the substitution replaces it with smaller tiles. 

Alternatively, considering the dots as points in a sequence, maybe the substitution rule is that each tile (which could be a segment between two dots) is replaced by a smaller segment with dots in between. For example, if the original has dots at 0,1,2,..., the substitution might replace each interval between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, etc., with a new set of dots that are spaced in a way that continues the sparsity. But the description says "increasingly sparse as x increases," so maybe the spacing between dots increases exponentially or geometrically. 

Wait, another angle: substitution tilings often have a substitution rule that replaces a tile with a number of smaller tiles arranged in a specific pattern. If the image shows a linear arrangement of dots becoming sparser, maybe the substitution is replacing each tile (which could be a row of dots) with a row where each dot is replaced by a certain number of dots, with some spacing. For example, if the original has dots at positions 0,1,2,..., the substitution might replace each dot at position n with dots at positions n and n + k, where k increases as n increases, leading to sparser spacing. 

But maybe a simpler approach: if the dots are at positions 0,1,2,..., and the substitution rule is to replace each dot with a dot at the same position and a dot at a position that's a multiple, say, replacing each dot at x with dots at x and x + 1, but with the new spacing being such that the density decreases. Wait, the key might be recognizing the substitution rule as a specific fractal, like the Cantor set, but in one dimension. The Cantor set starts with [0,1], removes the middle third, leaving [0,1/3] and [2/3,1], then repeats. The positions here might correspond to the endpoints of the intervals, which are 0,1/3,2/3,1, etc., which are getting sparser as you go. But the description says "dots at various positions, such as x=0, x=1, x=2, and so on," which might not fit the Cantor set directly. 

Alternatively, if the substitution rule is that each tile (which could be a segment between two dots) is replaced by a smaller segment with a dot in the middle, but with increasing spacing. Wait, the problem says "the image consists of a series of white dots on a black background, arranged in a linear fashion. There are dots at various positions, such as x=0, x=1, x=2, and so on. The dots become increasingly sparse as x increases, giving the appearance of a continuous line that connects them." So maybe the substitution is replacing each dot at position x with a dot at position x and a dot at position x + 1, but with the new spacing being such that the distance between dots increases by a factor, say, 2 each time. Wait, if you start with dots at 0,1,2,..., then the substitution might replace each dot at n with dots at n and n + 2, but that might not fit. 

Wait, another thought: substitution rules often have a finite number of replacement rules. If the image shows a linear arrangement where each "block" (like a unit interval with dots) is replaced by smaller blocks, maybe the substitution is replacing each tile with two smaller tiles with a gap in between, similar to the Cantor set, but with the dots representing the endpoints. If the original has dots at 0,1,2,..., the substitution might replace each interval between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, etc., with a new set of dots at 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, but the description says x=0,1,2,..., which are integers. Hmm, maybe the substitution rule is that each tile (which is a single dot) is replaced by a dot at the same position and a dot at the next position, but with the next position being spaced further out. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing without seeing the image, but based on the description, the key is that the dots become sparser as x increases, so the substitution rule likely involves replacing each tile with a number of smaller tiles where the spacing between dots increases, perhaps by a factor of 2 each time, leading to a fractal structure. 

Alternatively, if we model the positions as a sequence where each step replaces each dot with a dot at the same position and a dot at a position that's a multiple, say, replacing each dot at x with dots at x and x + 1, but with the new spacing being such that the distance between dots in the new generation is larger. For example, starting with dots at 0,1,2,..., the first substitution replaces each dot at n with dots at n and n + 2, resulting in dots at 0,2,4,... and 1,3,5,..., which are sparser. But the description says "increasingly sparse as x increases," so maybe the spacing increases as x increases, like replacing each dot at n with dots at n and n + 2^n, but that might be too complex. 

Wait, going back to substitution rules in tiling, a common example is the Sierpinski triangle, but that's 2D. In 1D, the Cantor set is a substitution tiling where each interval is replaced by two smaller intervals. The positions of the dots (endpoints) would be 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, etc., which are getting sparser as you go. If the image has dots at integer positions (0,1,2,...), maybe the substitution is different. Suppose the substitution rule is replacing each dot at position x with dots at positions x and x + 1, but with the new spacing being such that the distance between dots in the next generation is 2 times the previous, leading to dots at 0,1,2,..., 1,3,5,..., 2,6,10,..., which are increasingly sparse. But the description says "dots become increasingly sparse as x increases," so maybe the substitution is that each dot at position n is replaced by a dot at position n and a dot at position n + k, where k increases as n increases. 

Alternatively, if the image shows a linear arrangement where each "block" (like a segment between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, etc.) is replaced by a smaller segment with a dot in the middle, but with the middle dot's position increasing. Wait, if you start with dots at 0,1,2,..., the substitution might replace each interval [n, n+1] with a dot at n + 1/2, but then the dots would be at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, etc., which are sparser. But the original description says dots at x=0,1,2,..., which are integer positions, not half-integers. 

I think I need to make an educated guess based on the description. The key points are: linear arrangement, dots at x=0,1,2,..., sparser as x increases, continuous line connecting them. This sounds like a fractal where each iteration replaces each segment with smaller segments, leading to dots that are spaced further apart as x increases. A common substitution rule for such a structure might be replacing each tile (which could be a unit interval with a dot at each end) with two smaller intervals with a gap in between, but with the gap increasing. However, if the dots are at integer positions and become sparser, maybe the substitution rule is that each dot at position n is replaced by a dot at position n and a dot at position n + 2, then n + 4, etc., but I need a more precise rule. 

Wait, another approach: the substitution rule for the tile is likely a specific rule where each tile is replaced by a certain number of smaller tiles, and the positions of the dots follow a pattern where each step adds dots at positions that are multiples of a certain ratio. If the dots become sparser as x increases, the ratio might be increasing, like 1, 1/2, 1/4, etc., but in integer positions, maybe replacing each dot at n with dots at n and n + 1, but with the new spacing being such that the distance between dots in the next generation is 2 times the previous. For example, first generation: 0,1,2,...; second generation: 0,2,4,... and 1,3,5,...; third generation: 0,4,8,..., 2,6,10,..., 1,5,9,..., which are increasingly sparse. This is similar to the Cantor set but with a different spacing. The substitution rule here would be replacing each dot with two dots spaced by twice the original spacing. 

Given the description, the substitution rule is probably replacing each tile (which could be a segment between two dots) with smaller segments where the dots are spaced further apart, following a pattern where each step doubles the spacing or follows a geometric progression. Since the problem mentions "substitution rule for the tile" and the image has dots at x=0,1,2,... becoming sparser, the substitution rule might be: replace each tile (which is a unit interval with a dot at each end) with two smaller intervals, each of length 1/2, with a gap of 1/2 in between, but in integer terms, maybe replacing each interval [n, n+1] with [n, n + 1/2] and [n + 3/2, n + 2], but this is getting too vague. 

Given the lack of the actual image, but based on the description of dots at integer positions becoming sparser, the substitution rule is likely a standard fractal substitution where each step replaces each element with two elements with a certain spacing, leading to the sparsity. A common example is the Cantor set substitution rule, which is replacing each interval with two intervals of half the length, but in the context of the problem, if the dots are at integer positions, maybe the substitution is replacing each dot at position n with dots at positions n and n + 1, but with the new spacing being such that the distance between dots in the next generation is 2, leading to dots at 0,1,2,..., 1,3,5,..., 2,6,10,..., which are increasingly sparse. The substitution rule would then be: for each tile (which is a dot), replace it with two dots, one at the same position and one at the next position, but with the next position being spaced further out. However, without more details, the most likely substitution rule is similar to the Cantor set, where each step removes the middle part, but adapted to the linear arrangement described. 

Final guess: The substitution rule is that each tile (which could be a unit interval with a dot at each end) is replaced by two smaller intervals, each of length 1/2, with a gap of 1/2 in between, leading to dots at positions that are endpoints of these smaller intervals, which become sparser as x increases. Therefore, the substitution rule is replacing each interval with two intervals of half the length, spaced appropriately, resulting in dots at positions that follow a fractal pattern with increasing sparsity.</think><answer>The substitution rule for the tile, based on the description of white dots on a black background arranged linearly with increasing sparsity as \( x \) increases, can be identified as a fractal substitution similar to the Cantor set. The key observation is that dots at integer positions (\( x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \)) become sparser, forming a continuous line. The substitution rule likely involves replacing each tile (e.g., a unit interval with a dot at each end) with two smaller intervals, each of half the original length, with a gap in between. This process recursively reduces the density of dots, following a pattern where spacing increases geometrically. Specifically, each step replaces each dot at position \( n \) with dots at \( n \) and \( n + 2 \), then \( n \) and \( n + 4 \), etc., leading to increasingly sparse dot positions.
