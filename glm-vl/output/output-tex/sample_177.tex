<think>Got it, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is talking about a TikZ arrow shape not being visible when a certain command is commented out. First, let's recall how TikZ arrow styles work. The `tikzset` command is used to define styles, maybe for arrows. If commenting out that command makes the arrow disappear, that suggests the original style was being set, and removing it removes the style, so the arrow can't be drawn.

Let's break it down. Suppose the first code snippet has a `tikzset` command that defines an arrow style, like `set arrow style={...}`. When you comment that out, the style isn't defined, so when you try to draw an arrow, TikZ doesn't know what style to use, so the arrow doesn't appear. The second image (with the comment out) shows the arrow is gone, so the issue is that the arrow style was being set via `tikzset`, and removing that style removes the arrow's definition.

So the problem is likely that the `tikzset` command was defining the arrow's style, and when it's commented out, the style isn't applied, so the arrow can't be drawn. Therefore, the solution would be to ensure the arrow style is defined (either via `tikzset` or another method like `tikzset{every path/.style={...}}` or directly in the arrow options). But the question is what went wrong, so the mistake was probably not defining the arrow style properly when the `tikzset` was commented out, leading to the arrow not being visible.</think><answer>To determine what went wrong, let’s analyze the role of the `tikzset` command in defining arrow styles:  

1. **TikZ Arrow Styles**: The `tikzset` command is used to define custom styles (e.g., for arrows). If an arrow’s appearance depends on a style defined by `tikzset`, removing that style (by commenting out the `tikzset` command) would eliminate the style’s definition.  
2. **Effect of Commenting Out**: When the `tikzset` command is commented out, the arrow style it defined is no longer applied. Without the style, TikZ has no instructions for how to draw the arrow, so the arrow shape disappears.  

Thus, the issue is that the `tikzset` command was defining the arrow’s style, and commenting it out removed the style’s definition, causing the arrow to vanish.  

The answer is <|begin_of_box|>The `tikzset` command defined the arrow’s style, and commenting it out removed the style, so the arrow could not be drawn.<|end_of_box|></answer>
