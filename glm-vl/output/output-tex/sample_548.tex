\begin{tikzpicture}
  % Define the box
  \draw[fill=white] (-2, -2, -2) rectangle (2, 2, 2); % Assuming a cube from -2 to 2 in x,y,z
  % Then the sphere
  % For the sphere, maybe use a 3D sphere with red and green
  % Alternatively, use the sphere command if available, but TikZ's sphere might need 3d library
  % Let's use the 3d library's canvas
  \begin{scope}[on background layer]
    % Draw the sphere
    % Maybe use a combination of red and green with a white center
    % Alternatively, use a shading for the sphere
    % Let's try drawing the sphere as a 3D object
    \shade[ball color=red, opacity=0.8] (0,0,0) circle (1.5); % Red sphere
    \shade[ball color=green, opacity=0.8] (0,0,0) circle (1.5); % Green sphere, but maybe overlapping
    % Wait, maybe better to use a two-color sphere by using a path with two colors
    % Or use a 3D sphere with a hole
    % Alternatively, use the "sphere" shape from the "3d" library
    % Wait, the "3d" library has commands like \shade[ball color=red] (0,0,0) circle (1.5); but need to set the perspective
    % Let's set the perspective first
    \begin{scope}[x={(-0.7071cm,-0.7071cm)}, y={(0.7071cm,-0.7071cm)}, z={(0cm,1cm)}] % 45-degree perspective
      \shade[ball color=red, opacity=0.8] (0,0,0) circle (1.5);
      \shade[ball color=green, opacity=0.8] (0,0,0) circle (1.5);
      % Or, maybe a better way: draw the sphere with red and green, and then a white circle in the center
      % But for 3D, maybe use a 3D sphere with a hollow center
      % Alternatively, use the "sphere" command from the "shapes" library, but that's 2D
      % Maybe better to use the "3d" library's canvas and draw the sphere as a 3D object
      % Let's try:
      \begin{scope}[canvas is xy plane at z=0]
        \fill[white] (0,0) circle (0.5); % White center
      \end{scope}
      \begin{scope}[canvas is xz plane at y=0]
        \fill[red] (-1.5,0) rectangle (1.5,1.5); % Red part
      \end{scope}
      \begin{scope}[canvas is yz plane at x=0]
        \fill[green] (-1.5,0) rectangle (1.5,1.5); % Green part
      \end{scope}
    \end{scope}
  \end{scope}
