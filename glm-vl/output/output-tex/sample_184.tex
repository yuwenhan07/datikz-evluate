<think>Got it, let's try to figure out what the question is about. The user mentioned a "normal matrix M(,)." Wait, maybe there's a typo? Maybe they mean a matrix M with some properties, like being normal (which in linear algebra means M*M = MM* where M* is the conjugate transpose). But the image description is about overlapping squares with formulas, maybe a visual representation? Wait, the question might be about interpreting the image's mathematical content, but the user's question is a bit unclear. Wait, let me read again: "The normal matrix M(,)." Maybe the question is asking about the properties of a normal matrix M, or perhaps identifying the matrix from the image? But the image is described as squares with formulas, maybe each square has a matrix element or formula related to normal matrices. Hmm, since the user says "put the final answer in a box," maybe the question is a standard one about normal matrices, like stating their properties, or maybe the matrix M is a specific example. Wait, without more specific info from the image's formulas, it's hard, but maybe the question is a general one about normal matrices. Wait, the initial question might be: "What is a normal matrix M?" or "Explain the properties of a normal matrix M." But given the image has formulas, maybe the formulas are like M*M = MM* or eigenvalues are real, etc. Alternatively, if the image shows a matrix with those properties, but since I need to infer, maybe the key point is that a normal matrix is one that commutes with its conjugate transpose, so M* M = M M*, and such matrices are diagonalizable by a unitary matrix. But since the user's question is a bit vague, maybe the intended answer is about the definition or properties. Alternatively, if the image's formulas include something like M^T M = M M^T (for real matrices), then that's the condition. But given the user's description, maybe the final answer is the definition of a normal matrix, boxed. Wait, but the user wrote "The normal matrix M(,)." Maybe M is a matrix with entries that satisfy the normality condition. Alternatively, if the image has a specific matrix, but without seeing it, it's tricky. Wait, maybe the question is simply asking for the property of a normal matrix, and the answer is that a normal matrix satisfies M* M = M M*, and such matrices are unitarily diagonalizable. But since the user wants the final answer in a box, maybe stating the condition. Alternatively, if the image's formulas are part of the matrix elements, but without more info, I'll assume the question is about the definition of a normal matrix, so the answer is that a normal matrix M satisfies M* M = M M*, and the final answer in a box would be the condition.</think><answer>The question involves a normal matrix \( M \), which in linear algebra is defined as a matrix satisfying \( M^* M = M M^* \) (where \( M^* \) denotes the conjugate transpose of \( M \)). Normal matrices are unitarily diagonalizable, meaning there exists a unitary matrix \( U \) such that \( U^* M U \) is diagonal. Based on the properties of normal matrices, the key defining condition is the equality of the matrix with its conjugate transpose product.  

The answer is \(<|begin_of_box|>M^* M = M M^* (or equivalent properties of normal matrices)<|end_of_box|>\).</answer>
