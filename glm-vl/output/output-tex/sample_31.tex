<think>Got it, let's try to understand the problem. The task is to modify a spiral-like arrangement of arcs into a circle with three layers, where specific arcs are moved to different layers. Let's break down the requirements:

First, the original has a spiral-like structure, and we need to rearrange arcs B_4, B_7 to the same layer as B_1; B_5, B_8 to the same layer as B_2; B_6 to the same layer as B_3. This results in three layers. 

We need to describe how to modify the arcs' positions (layers) to form a circle with labeled arcs in the center of each arc. Since the original code isn't provided, we need to outline the steps for modifying the arcs' layers.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Identify the original layers: The spiral likely has multiple layers, maybe starting from the center outward. The goal is to group arcs into three layers: let's say Layer 1 (B_1), Layer 2 (B_2, B_6), Layer 3 (B_3, B_4, B_5, B_7, B_8)? Wait, the problem says "three layers instead of a spiral" with B_4 and B_7 moved to B_1's layer, B_5 and B_8 to B_2's layer, B_6 to B_3's layer. So Layer 1: B_1, B_4, B_7; Layer 2: B_2, B_5, B_8; Layer 3: B_3, B_6. Wait, need to check the exact move: "B_4 and B_7 are moved to the same layer as B_1, while B_5 and B_8 are moved to the same layer as B_2 and B_6 is moved to the same layer as B_3". So Layer 1 (original B_1's layer) now has B_1, B_4, B_7; Layer 2 (original B_2's layer) has B_2, B_5, B_8; Layer 3 (original B_3's layer) has B_3, B_6. Then arrange these layers in a circular manner, each layer being a circle of arcs.

2. For each arc, adjust their position (layer) to the specified layer. For example, arc B_4's original layer is probably higher in the spiral, so moving it to B_1's layer means placing it in the same circular layer as B_1. Similarly for others.

3. Ensure that each arc is embedded in the center of its arc (wait, the problem says "labeled arcs embedded in the center of each arc" – maybe each arc has a label in its center, so when modifying, make sure the labels are in the center of each arc in their new layer.

4. The final structure is a circle with three concentric layers (or maybe arranged in a circle with three rings), each ring being a layer of arcs.

Since the original code isn't provided, we need to describe the modification process. Let's structure the answer by explaining the layer reassignment and the resulting circular arrangement.

First, identify the original arcs' layers. Suppose the original spiral has arcs in layers 1 (innermost), 2, 3, etc., going outward. To form three layers:

- Layer 1 (innermost) will contain B_1, B_4, B_7 (as per the move: B_4 and B_7 moved here)
- Layer 2 will contain B_2, B_5, B_8 (B_5 and B_8 moved here)
- Layer 3 (outermost) will contain B_3, B_6 (B_6 moved here)

Then, arrange each layer as a circle (so each layer is a circle of arcs, maybe arranged in a circular pattern around the center). Each arc in a layer is placed in a circular arrangement, with their labels in the center of each arc (so each arc is a segment of the circle, with the label in the center of that segment).

So the steps would be:

- For each arc, check its original layer. If it's B_4 or B_7, move it to the layer containing B_1. If it's B_5 or B_8, move to the layer containing B_2. If it's B_6, move to the layer containing B_3.
- Once all arcs are assigned to their new layers, arrange each layer's arcs in a circular pattern (so each layer forms a circle, maybe with arcs placed around the center, each arc being a part of the circle for that layer).
- Ensure that each arc's label is embedded in the center of its arc (so the label is inside the arc's segment, maybe in the middle of the arc's span).

Since the problem mentions the image on the right is a reference, but we need to refer to the original code for accuracy, but since we don't have the code, we can describe the modification logic.

So, summarizing the process:

1. Reassign arc layers:
   - Move arcs B_4 and B_7 from their original positions to the layer containing B_1.
   - Move arcs B_5 and B_8 from their original positions to the layer containing B_2.
   - Move arc B_6 from its original position to the layer containing B_3.
2. Arrange each of the three new layers (each containing B_1's group, B_2's group, B_3's group) into a circular arrangement, so that each layer forms a circle of arcs around the center.
3. For each arc in the new layers, ensure that the label is embedded in the center of the arc (i.e., the label is placed inside the arc's segment, possibly at the midpoint of the arc's span).

This would result in a circle with three concentric layers of arcs, each layer having the specified arcs, with labels in the center of each arc.</think><answer>To modify the spiral-like layers of arcs into a circle with labeled arcs in the center of each arc, follow these steps:  


### Step 1: Reassign Arc Layers  
- **Move B₄ and B₇** to the same layer as B₁.  
- **Move B₅ and B₈** to the same layer as B₂.  
- **Move B₆** to the same layer as B₃.  

This reorganization groups the arcs into three distinct layers (replacing the original spiral structure).  


### Step 2: Arrange Layers into a Circular Pattern  
After reassigning layers, arrange each new layer as a **concentric circle** (or circular ring) around the center. Each layer contains the arcs assigned in Step 1. For example:  
- **Layer 1 (innermost)**: Contains B₁, B₄, B₇. Arrange these arcs in a circular pattern (e.g., evenly spaced around the center).  
- **Layer 2 (middle)**: Contains B₂, B₅, B₈. Arrange these arcs in a circular pattern, larger than Layer 1.  
- **Layer 3 (outermost)**: Contains B₃, B₆. Arrange these arcs in a circular pattern, larger than Layer 2.  


### Step 3: Embed Labels in the Center of Each Arc  
For each arc in the new circular layers, place its label **in the center of the arc** (e.g., at the midpoint of the arc’s span). This ensures each arc has a labeled center, as shown in the reference image.  


By reassigning layers and arranging them into concentric circles with labels in the arc centers, the original spiral structure is transformed into a circle with three layers of arcs.  

The answer is <|begin_of_box|>3<|end_of_box|> (since the result is a circle with three layers).</answer>
