    \caption{Left: Partial and whole spherical linkage of a mesh in Fig. \ref{sqmesh}. The segments labeled as $(\lambda_{i}, \gamma_{i}, \mu_{i}, \delta_{i}, \alpha_{i}, \beta_{i})$ and $(\lambda_{i}', \gamma_{i}', \mu_{i}', \delta_{i}', \alpha_{i}', \beta_{i}')$ are complementary to $\pi$. The gap between $\beta_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ is due to the overlapping segments $\tau_{1}$ and $\zeta_{1}$.}
