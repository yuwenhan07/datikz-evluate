The Penrose diagram of the CPT conjugated of the TCC-violating expanding solution that satisfies our assumptions is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:penrose_diagram}. 

If we start with the past vacuum state ($t \rightarrow -\infty$), there will be particle production at the moment of transition from Phase II to Phase I, as indicated by the arrows. Under our assumptions, Phase I lasts long enough to blue-shift those particles to trans-Planckian energies that violate the Effective Field Theory (EFT).
