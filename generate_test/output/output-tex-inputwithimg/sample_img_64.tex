Description:
The SIRV compartmental model for COVID-19 disease dynamics consists of five compartments: Susceptible ($S$), Exposed ($E$), Quarantined ($U$), Recovered ($R$), and Vaccinated ($V$). Three doses of vaccination are assumed, with the second and third vaccinations occurring 28 and 180 days after the first dose. The transmission rate is $\beta$, the recovery rate is $\delta$, the rate of returning to susceptibility after infection is $\gamma$, the vaccination rates are $\alpha_i$ for the $i^{th}$ vaccination, calculated as a proportion of those who received the previous vaccine, and $\phi_i$ represents the rate at which vaccination immunity wears off for the $i^{th}$ vaccination.
