Examples of singular free boundary points where the function $u - \psi$ has strict quadratic growth. We expect quadratic growth in the direction of the \textcolor{myred}{red} arrows. The case on the right is more degenerate than the case on the left, and worse for the approximation of the free boundary $\Gamma$ (depicted in \textcolor{myblue}{blue}). In both cases we have that $\dim \ker \mathbf{A} = 1$. A discrete free boundary $\Gamma_{\Delta}$, which is at a distance $\mathcal{O}(\delta(h)^{1/2})$ is depicted in \textcolor{mybrown}{dashed brown}.
